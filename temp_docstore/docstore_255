Women and men use urban services, access urban environments, but city living affects their lives differently. Women experience high rates of sexual and gender based violence in urban contexts, particularly in public transport and unsafe community spaces. Furthermore, since women in many societies are more likely than men to work in or near the home, they are less likely to commute long distances23. For their more frequent, local trips, women tend to rely on public transport, if it exists, and is safe and affordable. Some cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai have, for example, responded to frequent sexual and gender based violence in public transport by introducing \u2018women only\u2019 buses and special compartments in trains24. It is vital that the impact of these multi- dimensional challenges on the location of facilities and services as well as the design of cities and urban poverty interventions be better understood by urban development stakeholders in the region. 21 Budlender, D. 2010.

The Urban Poor and Climate Change The human dimensions of climate change, especially its impacts on the daily challenges of the urban poor in terms of employment, livelihoods, safety, health, housing, and access to basic services are critical for successful policies to create inclusive and resilient cities. Climate change presents numerous challenges in the urban context. Its impact is expected to hit those living in poverty the hardest. Traditionally, cities were located near rivers and oceans for a myriad of reasons, including transportation to facilitate international trade networks and access to potable water for drinking and agriculture. Therefore, they are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and increasing severity and frequency of flooding. By and large, cities have high concentrations of the poor who are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Poor city residents in Asia-Pacific tend to live in the most vulnerable locations, such as the low-lying coastal areas, which are particularly vulnerable to storm surges (see Figure 1). Poor communities are often concentrated in flood-prone areas alongside rivers or even directly on watercourses, and also on steep and unstable land.

Given the deprived living conditions in slum or squatter settlements, the urban poor are more susceptible to climate-related risks, which have increased the likelihood of more frequent and severe flooding, compounded by non-climate factors (such as land subsidence and poor drainage). The urban poor living in peri-urban areas and slums are particularly vulnerable as they disproportionately live in high risk unplanned areas and poorly constructed homes, have limited access to basic and emergency services, lack voice and access to civil and political rights, and suffer from a general lack of economic resilience.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e13cf7c5-40fd-49f8-8879-1ecfae7aeae6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e13cf7c5-40fd-49f8-8879-1ecfae7aeae6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/urbanization-and-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Urbanization and Climate Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/urbanization-and-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "969ed3c8ed2dd53eec0503ab942dd1c90a17f4c6b7f1e9a31c597b8bdf67e4dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f36ab54-17ca-4193-a1a1-4efd81069cbc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/urbanization-and-climate-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1dcf0f26610fc975a8f67959ec5f7ab2b40f2c1011806313e7e8adee8a5c968c"}}, "hash": "1dda086ad4687e294433db5df05c8d95c93cbdc33f1da33b8e3b364b9f06e2e3", "text": "7 The urban poor have to make difficult choices in regard to where they reside.

Moreover, climate change aggravates water resource constraints for the urban poor; growing demand, decreasing availability and quality will increase general water prices and have profound impacts on people's health.25 Informal settlements without piped water often get their water delivered in tankers, generally paying much more than the rich26. Due to limited resources, cities in Asia-Pacific developing countries also have relatively limited sewage systems.27 In addition, the region, especially South Asia, has some of the world\u2019s worst urban sanitation coverage, ranked higher than that of only Sub-Saharan Africa (see Figure 2). Similarly, changes in global temperature and precipitation can also lead to the expansion of dengue, malaria and other infectious diseases.

UN Photo/Kibae Park As Asia-Pacific continues to urbanize, many of the region\u2019s development challenges \u2013 job creation and poverty reduction, governance and access to services, climate change and environmental sustainability \u2013 will be focused in its cities. The coming years will see massive physical, economic and social change, local and global climate consequences. What is clear is that the growth of cities will continue and successfully managing city growth will be critical to development outcomes and social stability. The future prospects for people in Asia-Pacific cities will be determined by the development response to rising urban poverty, inequality and vulnerability to climate change. Limited access to basic social services, social protection and weak or non-existent social networks has magnified the adverse impacts of climate change on poor urban dwellers. These can be even more pronounced in peri-urban regions, where human settlements exist in unplanned areas where government authority between municipal and central government often overlap and conflict. Given the rapid unplanned growth of many Asia-Pacific cities, they often do not have adequate capacity or infrastructure to deliver basic services to the poor and marginalized. In addition, social exclusion and gender discrimination exacerbate the limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, healthcare, basic education, and infrastructure to address the impact of climate-related risks and natural disasters.28 Given the rapid growth and density of urban populations and informal settlements, the urban poor and marginalized groups tend to have inadequate access to social protection and therefore rely on ineffective public healthcare systems. Primary healthcare is inaccessible to the urban poor due to a number of reasons, including high costs, limited services and lack of information. In fact, a substantial number of the urban poor do not have legal status that gives them access to basic social services in the city. Climate change increases the complexity of urban service delivery, which largely depends on robust infrastructure as well as socio-political factors. Improving resilience of urban cities is imperative to deal with these issues in the face of global warming and climate change. 28 UNICEF and IIED (International Institute for Environment and Sustainable Development). 2013.

These include land development policies in cities that do not keep pace with rapid urbanization, climate impacts, housing and land regulations and the lack of access to housing finance mechanisms for disadvantaged groups29.

Slum residents would like their houses to be more resilient but they lack sufficient resources to do so or are reluctant to spend on permanent structures when they lack title to the land they are building on. As a consequence, these houses rarely comply with official safety standards and there are no controls in place. Most buildings are used intensively \u2013 with high levels of overcrowding and a mix of living and working spaces. This is often combined with a lack of maintenance and with environmental conditions (e.g. proximity to river edges and coastal areas) that cause rapid deterioration. Houses are not as solid or as insulated as they should be and are often built on inadequate foundations (many on land\ufb01lls or unstable land). Also, most low-income groups live in housing without adequate air circulation or insulation, and during heat waves, the very young, the elderly and people in poor health are particularly at risk30. The poor quality of housing is an additional vulnerability factor to climate-induced disasters. III. Toward More Inclusive and Resilient Cities in Asia and the Pacific While cities now occupy centre stage in the region\u2019s economic growth and development, the twin challenges posed by rapid urbanization and climate change are not yet reflected in most national policies and plans. The climate challenges of urbanization across countries in the region occur at enormously different scales, scope, geography and levels of impact. The biggest challenge, as illustrated above, is that its causes and effects are multi-dimensional. Holistic strategies to address urban poverty and climate change require substantial investment in resilient livelihoods, housing, improved service delivery, gender sensitive planning and a responsive and inclusive governance and policy environment. Resilience can be promoted through bottom-up and top-down approaches. Community- based programmes and initiatives that have been successfully implemented in the region include early warning systems and saving schemes, among others. However, building resilient communities also requires governmental action. In Asia-Pacific, as the urban population is growing fast and the undeveloped land available for housing is decreasing, the need for equitable land management by the state is increasingly recognized. Institutionalizing secure tenure approaches for men and women that favour alternatives to private land ownership, such as community leases, occupancy rights, rental, and usufruct arrangements, provides opportunities for citywide planning that is flexible and sustainable. This institutionalization could accelerate the regularization of 29 UN-HABITAT. 2011. Affordable Land and Housing in Asia \u2013Volume 2.

Related experiences from many cities in the Philippines, for example, has shown that formalizing the tenure of informal settlements triggered the provision of resilient services to these communities, not only by government, but also by private entities such as utility companies and civic organizations31. The urban poor are more willing to invest in legalizing their water and power connections when tenure is more secure. Secure tenure and equal property rights are critical issues for women and these depend in large part on their ability to own economic assets such as land and housing. In many societies found in the region, women can be excluded from the purchase of property, inheritance and decisions about land and property resources. The increasing frequency and intensity of climate induced disasters, rising poverty, and vulnerability of the urban poor to these impacts, is bringing about greater awareness among governments in the region for the need to sustainably address and adapt to climate change risks. In order to adapt , these communities will require concerted support from both public and private institutions.

Since its establishment in 2002, the Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Initiative (APTII) at the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo has contributed to developing approaches and strategies which help align trade dynamics with the objectives of poverty reduction and human development in the Asia-Pacific region. The APTII has promoted innovative research and policy advice that seek to clearly define the substantive linkages between trade and human development and is consistent with the objective of supporting the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Striving to build on its previous work and achievements, in its third and current phase of the work programme (2008-2011), the APTII aspires to make a significant contribution to policy dialogues by fostering regional trade and investment regimes that are consistent with human development goals in the region. A central challenge facing policy-makers in the region is to facilitate patterns of inclusive regional integration that enable them to ad- dress specific development priorities and goals, particularly with reference to the develop- ment needs of least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). The focus, for APTII\u2019s current work programme therefore, will be on 1) enhancing trade competitiveness and capacity development to formulate employment- and gender-responsive trade policies; and 2) capacity strengthen- ing to implement pro-poor regional integration strategies, including through key regional processes and/or mechanisms. In line with this focus, APTII will publish a series of studies and discussion papers which shall highlight the policy implications of the multifaceted dimensions of the current trade trends and patterns and their human development impacts in the Asia-Pacific region. The current study, Who\u2019s Afraid of Industrial Policy?, by Emel Memi\u015f and Manuel F. Montes seeks to examine the rationale and relevance of industrial policy for countries in an open economy setting. Many observers consider that strategic trade and industrial policies have propelled the success of East Asian economies leading to significant poverty reduction. Industrial policy is seen as a key driver for increasing the participation of new productive Preface vii sectors in domestic economy across the agriculture, industry and services sectors. The paper has conducted a survey of the industrialization experience in the Asia-Pacific while drawing out the critical policy lessons and mapping the challenges for the future. We hope that the study would be useful to the governments, UNDP country offices, research institutions, civil society and other stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific region in further- ing the debate on operationalizing the concept of industrial policy in diverse settings.

This study surveys the industrialization experience in the Asia-Pacific, drawing lessons and indicating challenges for the future. A lesson that can be drawn from this region of \u2018success- ful\u2019 globalizers is that development through strategic, as opposed to passive, integration into the external economy is possible. In the successful Asia-Pacific economies, the State played an indispensable role in undertaking the strategic integration, through various policies that can be categorized as industrial policy. The key thesis that this paper seeks to develop is that industrial policy, defined as State intervention to support new production activities and to build domestic capabilities in specific areas, is even more indispensable for countries seeking to pursue their development by integrating internationally. Governments are \u2018doomed to choose\u2019 to undertake \u2018industrial policy\u2019, whether consciously or otherwise. The more dependent countries are on exports and the international economy, the more unavoidable is industrial policy due to specific features in technology when undertaking efforts in capability building. This paper makes the argument that governments in developing countries would be better off having a deliberate and explicit industrial policy, consistent with their natural endowments, their stage of development, and their political arrangements. Industrial policy involves the configuration and management of relations between the State, on the one hand, and investors, capitalists, and firms, on the other. When development is redefined as the reduction of poverty, effective industrial policy occurs when the ongoing relationship of firms and production units to the State results in risk-taking, technical upgrading, invest- ment, and growth that reduces poverty. The paper also explores the required capacities that States need for industrial policy, addressing the observations that governments do not have the knowledge and tools to intervene and that the international rules severely constrict the space of governments to do so. It discusses the role of policy space and the kind of reforms in the international arena that are needed to permit countries to be truly responsible for their own development. Executive summary 1 Trade policy plays an indispensable role in poverty reduction. A productive interaction with the international economy is necessary for upgrading domestic productivity through the adaptation of foreign technology and processes and the exploitation of external markets to reduce domestic unemployment. This paper discusses the channels through which trade and government policy interact in efforts to raise domestic productivity through the process of industrialization. It can be said that nations that have risen out of poverty have done so through the process of industrialization. While it is entirely possible that external trade in the services sector, which has recently been increasingly acquiring importance in certain developing countries, such as India, will make possible another path out of poverty without industrial- ization, the only proven path out of underdevelopment at the time of this writing, however, has been through industrialization. The transformation of a society from a pre-industrial to an industrial one has involved the following elements: (i) a qualitative increase in the use of capital and machinery in the produc- tion of goods and services and consequent increase in the productivity of labour; and (ii) the large-scale production of goods of high technological content, and consequently falling costs, and the attainment of international competi- tiveness. These changes have been accompanied by, and have induced, a significant diver- sification of production, labour skills, and professions and profound changes in social and political institutions. It is a truism that development is coincident with structural change, a permanent change in the kinds of goods produced by and the kinds of jobs needed in an economy. This study surveys the industrialization experience in the Asia-Pacific, drawing lessons and indicating challenges for the future. A lesson that can be drawn from this region of \u2018suc- cessful\u2019 globalizers is that development through strategic, as opposed to passive, integration into the external economy is possible (APTII 2005). The State played an indispensable role in undertaking the strategic integration, through various policies that can be categorized as industrial policy. The key thesis that this paper seeks to develop is that industrial policy, 1. Introduction 2 defined as State intervention to support new production activities and to build domestic capabilities in specific areas, is even more indispensable for countries seeking to pursue their development by integrating internationally. If, as observers such as Bhagwati (2004) suggest, international economic integration is not a matter of national choice in the current \u2018era of \u201cglobalization\u201d\u2019, then the capacity to undertake effective industrial policy is a matter of social survival.

The year 2015 had been agreed to the point at which these targets were to be achieved. In order to generate the resources to meet these commit- ments, it is clear that States must find a way to ensure that their economies grow at about double the rates of growth of the last 25 years (UNCTAD 2005). In the last four years, growth in the many developing countries, including in many least developed countries, has been at elevated levels because of high commodity prices. Even if all developing countries were to meet the MDG targets in 2015, there is still the question of whether developing countries would have installed the domestic capacity required to sustain the achievement of the MDGs. The industrial economies that have met these targets have also reached a requisite proportion of total production and total employed labour in the more productive manu- facturing and services sectors. They have also \u201cachieved\u201d at least a minimum level of public services and public spending as a proportion of GDP based on their own domestic tax base (that is, not augmented by foreign aid, as is the case in many least developed countries). The levels of public spending are certainly still quite low in economies that used to be classified in the category of \u201cThird World.\u201d The issue is not that of raising the proportion of public sec- tor GDP, but of raising the productivity of both the public and private sector so that society can afford to devote a higher proportion of income to public services. Improving domestic productivity is thus the only permanent way to achieve the MDGs. Sufficient progress in upgrading domestic productivity and State capability should thus not be neglected in efforts to achieve the MDGs, and this is where attention to indus- trial policy is required. There is a common argument that says that openness to the global economy can be relied upon as the means to upgrade domestic productivity. The discus- sion in this paper seeks to illustrate that productivity upgrading has not been an automatic outcome of market forces historically and unlikely to be automatic in the future precisely because of the forces of globalization1. In fact, market pressures could be premature and obviate productivity increases because productivity efforts require investment and the risk- taking that is involved in investment. 1 The ongoing food price crisis illustrates some of the features of globalization. First, there are asymmetries in produc- tion that, in spite of increased diversification potentially offered by globalization, are concentrating and cumulative and not self-correcting-otherwise the sudden rise of prices of food, which is consumed almost everywhere, would not have occurred. Second, while the current high prices should encourage food production in all parts of the globe, installed capacity in many developing countries has declined due to competition from subsidized imports. Therefore, these developing countries are unable to respond and exploit the current high returns. Third, the international regime, in which industrial countries have the means to subsidize agricultural production, inflicts high uncertainty with regard to investments towards increased food production in developing countries, which are open to the world market. Fourth, the rechanneling of agricultural production toward biofuels, whether or not environmentally sustainable, is an instance of industrial policy. 3 There is also the question of whether the least developed countries (LDCs), small island states, and economies with small populations, that are determined to integrate and compete internationally, should even consider or afford industrial policy. Due to their situa- tion, many of these countries have installed regimes aspirant of, or even suppliant to, foreign investments which hold the promise of capturing foreign markets and technology. The conditions in these countries are, in fact, the conditions that require them to develop clear guidelines, regulations, and plans for industrial upgrading. While middle income countries and larger developing have a more diversified economic base, domestic markets in these types of countries are often too small to attract significant amounts of foreign investment. As the local market and labour force is relatively small, the entry of foreign companies could undermine genuine domestic competition and the development of a domestic private sec- tor. Many LDCs, for example, have pronounced their attraction toward developing their software and business process outsourcing services, because these are \u201cweightless\u201d exports and can absorb some of their labour force. While middle income countries, with diversified educational systems, have stumbled into this sector with limited purposeful planning, LDCs have to calculate how their domestic labour force can actually participate in these activities, the cost of upgrading domestic capabilities, and which international companies would", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a05fb412-1c90-4131-9a95-ca37a0b50bd3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a05fb412-1c90-4131-9a95-ca37a0b50bd3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5c663ef2b1698c867a41fb9f5f2201cd7aeefa9b143e5b8ed198dedd446f85b"}}, "hash": "c5c663ef2b1698c867a41fb9f5f2201cd7aeefa9b143e5b8ed198dedd446f85b", "text": "they need to attract. LDCs and small economies have to be deliberate (perhaps even more de- liberate than middle income countries) in identifying the interventions they invest to their limited public resources. They also have to be proactive in removing bottlenecks, facilitating diversification in industries, and enhancing infrastructure and skills. A general invitation and subsidy regime to attract any and all foreign investments without an accompanying industrial development plan by a small economy does not alleviate the \u201cinformational externality\u201d facing the foreign investor (Reinert 2004). It might not even attract a sufficient number of foreign investors for the purpose of development. It might also be the case that the net foreign exchange impact of the entry of foreign invested activities, which tend to be more import-dependent, is small or could be negative. If only to economize on foreign exchange, developing countries seeking foreign investment should seek to do so within an industrial development programme. As an exercise in pragmatism, liberalization policies in developing countries need to evaluate the probabilistic prospects in attracting foreign investment as a result and be informed by realistic estimates based on the experiences of similarly situated countries. This paper argues that a vision of industrial development suited to the specific con- ditions of each developing country is critical. If it is necessary to retain moral confidence among partners in Bretton Woods institutions and to sidestep the widespread conformism in views regarding trade and industrial development policies, then policy-makers in devel- oping countries might consider embedding these plans within an overall effort to upgrade capabilities. This upgrade might start from general education to more specific skills which are consistent with national priorities. Developing countries might even consider avoiding the formal use of the term \u201cindustrial policy\u201d altogether because - as explained the next sec- tion - the approach properly applies not just to manufacturing but, instead, to all activities characterized by constant or increasing returns to scale. The inherent feature of industrial policy as assistance for specific sectors could readily be justified on the grounds of limiting government support to a few strategic sectors. 4 In defining \u2018industrial policy\u2019, Chang\u2019s (1996: 60) conceptualization is found to be most useful as a starting point. Industrial policy is defined as being one that is aimed at particular industries (and firms as their components) to achieve outcomes that are perceived by the state to be efficient for the economy as a whole. First of all, industrial policy must be characterized by selectivity as far as industries are concerned. Differential tariffs, financial support for specific sectors of industry, and tax and import privileges for specific sectors are examples of selective State policies. State poli- cies that support an increase in capability of the whole economy, such as expenditures on education, are not properly part of industrial policy. State policies that benefit some specific sectors in a country\u2019s educational establishment in order to develop some specific industrial sector (for example, the design of electronic chips), would constitute industrial policy, even though the State expenditure for such policies would fall into the overall education budget of the State. Many developing countries have targeted tariff and tax incentives toward foreign in- vestments in chosen sectors. While these countries have claimed that they have dismantled their industrial policies, these kinds of tax and tariff incentives, because they privilege certain sectors, are instances of \u2018unconscious\u2019 industrial policy, motivated by the State\u2019s perception that foreign investment of particular types will be efficient for the economy as a whole (even though domestic investment in the same sectors might not be perceived to be efficient). Given the prevalence of such targeting of tariffs and tax incentives, it can be said that the dominant form of industrial policy that has been implicit since the 1980s has been directed toward foreign investors. It is important to point out that, as has been the case in actual practice2 in countries that have succeeded in industrializing, the use of the word \u2018industrial\u2019 in industrial policy does not mean that this type of policy can apply only to the manufacturing sector. Instead, what is important is the choice of specific industries that is subject to selective interven- tion. Within the mining and commodities exporting sector, for example, industrial policy 2. Industrialization 2 That \u2018industrial policy\u2019 is confined only to the manufacturing \u2018sector\u2019 is a common misconception on the part of critics. See, for example, the UNCTAD study by Bora et al.

Industrial policy has had an important role in agriculture. On the input side, historically, increases in agricultural productivity have not been possible without the inputs from the industrial sector and the increased ability of manufacturing to absorb the underemployed in agriculture. On the output side, targeted efforts to increase agricultural processing for both domestic and external consumption would properly be classified as industrial policy. Industrial policies are targeted to firms or groups of firms; not to popula- tion groups. These firms or group of firms could be involved in any of the three major classic economic sectors\u2014agriculture, industry, or services. Present-day thinking3 on industrial policy has identified a key principle in determin- ing the appropriate production sectors for government intervention, namely whether the firm is in an industry with increasing returns to scale (Reinert 1996). The standard economic definition of decreasing returns to scale is quite specific\u2014when one factor input to produc- tion is held constant, the yield from increasing the other factors exhibits a decreasing pat- tern. Decreasing returns are undefined when all4 factors are increased simultaneously. In the lower ranges of output, agriculture and other resource-based industries are not expected to have decreasing returns, but when the limit of fertile land and resource are used these industries would be subject to diminishing returns to scale. Reinert (2005) locates the role of the concept of diminishing returns to scale. Diminishing returns is mathematically necessary for Samuelson\u2019s5 (1948) proof that unfettered free trade6 will equalize labour and capital in- comes around the world and, therefore, will be \u2018good\u2019 for developing countries. Diminishing returns is a critical assumption to guarantee market clearing and thus the smooth transfer of production inputs from one economic sector to another. Reinert (2007) cautions that under globalization and the adherence by developing countries to standard policy regimes associ- ated with globalization, countries will find7 the Samuelson\u2019s convenient mathematical as- sumption becoming a reality, since these policies will limit their product mix to agricultural, resource-based, and other diminishing returns sectors. It would be inappropriate to consider mature sectors of industry, which have little potential for learning and upgrading both in scale and in technological terms, as possible targets of industrial policy, even those conventionally classified as \u2018industry\u2019 by statisticians. 3 See Reinert (1996). Reinert (2007) presents an integrated account of the range of challenges associated with modern industrial policy. 4 Over certain ranges of output, certain service industries would also not be subject to diminishing returns. For ex- ample, the business outsourcing industries could theoretically not be subject to one factor input being fixed as long as office space and telecommunications volume could be expanded easily. The key factor is English-speaking ability and there is evidence that the supply limit of this resource has been reached in some developing countries. 5 In a recent paper that provoked instantaneous controversy, Samuelson (2004) disavowed the improper interpreta- tion of his 1948 paper for purposes of policy advice. By incorporating technological dynamics, his 2004 paper demon- strated that under assumptions that most policy-makers would consider realistic, even the US economy itself might not benefit from unfettered free trade. 6 This result is the well-known \u2018Hecksher\u2013Ohlin\u2013Samuelson\u2019 theorem and is the key conceptual justification for trade liberalization. 7 Reinert (2007) terms this shift of industries towards these types of industries as the process of \u2018primitivization\u2019. 6 These types of industries tend also to be subject to market competition of the type in which producers have to take prices as given; State intervention in these kinds of industries will amount to a pure subsidy on costs in favour of global consumers and will not result in ad- vances in productivity. \u2018Regional\u2019 policy when not targeted to industrial sectors is excluded from industrial policy by Chang (1996). Also excluded is general infrastructure development, which would increase the competitiveness of the economy as a whole, but not targeted to specific sec- tors. A key element in Chang\u2019s (1996) definition of industrial policy is the intention of the policy. First, the definition leaves open the possibility that the State\u2019s \u2018perception\u2019 justifying the intervention in a specific sector could be erroneous.8 Second, the objective of policies that could be called \u2018industrial\u2019 is not equity9 but efficiency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecdebfc9-a7d6-45c9-9721-625dc8e8ed90": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecdebfc9-a7d6-45c9-9721-625dc8e8ed90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83bd12ec81843680f2b07a2119d1f071db6f522ec4a6d073133f65d16a64ec3b"}, "2": {"node_id": "abb93ff3-8768-46df-b691-64417f04c28b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9aa6ec777bea26bc27d2952cfad4b5ca176141f94409869d16b6b8221cb2aa86"}}, "hash": "769fc776da63d3cb35c93edf6a6d9eb4d3112e7a0a20e80045702f48de5a0027", "text": "The policy intention is to benefit the economy as a whole, not the specific sector, and not a specific political constituency.

Historically, the nation-state has been the basis for devel- opment during the capitalist era. The political structure of the nation-state has provided the \u2018capsule\u2019 within which poorer populations have changed their role in the international division of labour. The effectiveness of industrial and development policies depends on the context within which they are implemented. Do they favour capitalists and entrepreneurs more than workers? Are the policies dependent on the exploitation of the contributions of particular segments of the population? For example, historically, and in the current context of the economies of East Asia particularly, women have contributed enormously to efforts 8 The paper discusses in Section 2.2 some Southeast Asian examples of failures in industrial policy and the variety of reasons for their failure. The common approach is to decry the failures of the public sector in product planning and accept without comment similar mistakes by the private sector, ignoring the associated costs of inappropriate technol- ogy choices, employment dislocation, and obstacles to redeploying fixed capital to other uses from such failed private sector projects. We discuss later in this paper the political economy realities attending to private sector projects, which tend to result in a high incidence of public subsidy and/or protection in these kinds of projects. Industrial policy on the part of the public sector creates the capability inside the public sector to evaluate demands from the private sector for such subsidies. 9 In many liberalization episodes, improving \u2018equity\u2019 has been a key justification. Import liberalization is supposed to be more equitable to consumers, as opposed to producers, and to small- and medium-scale firms as opposed to large firms. Theoretically, conceiving of households principally from the point of view of consumption ignores, for the purposes of equity, their interests as producers and workers whose livelihoods (especially in the rural areas) and jobs could be made vulnerable. Empirically, it has been difficult to evaluate the equity justification. The structure of consumer demand is heavily conditioned by inherited income inequality, which trade liberalization often exacerbates. When import liberalization has been accompanied by an overall economic slowdown and increased macroeconomic volatility, it is futile to try to estimate the equity impact of import liberalization. Instead, appeals are often made to the \u2018dynamic\u2019 impact of the trade policy, which is in effect a reversion to the long-term \u2018efficiency\u2019 justification. Trade liberalization is, therefore, another type of industrial policy based on a perception by the State that it would be efficient for the economy as a whole. 10 This contrasts with views, such as that in Bora et al (2000), that the achievement of efficiency of the economy as a whole is impossible without achieving efficiency in each of the sectors of the economy separately. 7 to improve social and individual productivity and the international competitiveness of their economies. Industrial policy affects the functional distribution of income, and its sustainability and success depends on the continual changing in the balance of benefits from this policy. In the long-run, farmers, workers, and women have a permanent interest in the industrial development of their nation-states, since it has the potential of not only improving their income and standard of living, but also expanding their economic freedom. Whether this actually happens depends on the design and configuration of industrial policy. In the quan- titative test presented later in this paper, wage trends are taken as the key measure of the success of industrial policy. 2.1 Development strategies In the post World War II era, some countries in East Asia have followed the strategies of the earlier \u2018late industrializers\u2019 such as France and Germany and, within a generation, changed the kinds of products produced by their economies. In Asia, Japan was the first late indus- trializer, undertaking classic industrial policy in 1920s to climb up the industrial ladder from a feudal, agricultural economy. In the interwar period, Japan demonstrated the possibilities of exploiting its trading relations, which required paying attention to the need for \u2018selective\u2019 protection. For example, Miyajima (1992: 271) notes that in Japan\u2019s industrial policy, [a] pivotal consideration and constraint was that protection of a specific industry might jeopardize the benefits of trade. For example a dyestuffs tariff would affect the entire textile industry, and textiles were one of Japan\u2019s main exports. The Republic of Korea started its development process in 1963 as a poor agricultural economy. The Japanese colonial period left behind some industries in the northern Korean region but the southern region remained mainly agricultural, serving as a food basket for the Japanese economy.

These economies protected new industries against imports and subsidized investments in specific sectors. The economies of Malaysia and Thailand have also been generally considered as relatively successful. Until the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, other East Asian econo- mies such as Indonesia had also been considered to be on the road to industrialization. The spectacular success of China and the growing success of even later latecomer countries, such as India and Viet Nam, are the latest development success stories of the Asian region. China\u2019s share in world production of all manufacturing products increased from 1.7 percent in 1980 to 12.2 percent in 2003 (Table A1). Table A2 gives the breakdown of world industrial production by industry and country/region; the table confirms the dynamic growth of the share of China (from 0.9 percent in 1980 to 12.2 percent in 2003), South Korea (Republic of Korea) (from 0.7 percent in 1980 to 5.1 percent in 2003), Malaysia (from 0.2 8 percent to 1.7 percent in 2003), and Taiwan (Province of China) (from 1.1 percent in 1980 to 3.5 percent in 2003) in the world production of high-technology industries.11 East and Southeast Asian countries have generally been classified as export suc- cesses and as owing their development success to their engagement with the international economy. Particularly in comparison with Latin America, a region that, beginning in the 1980s undertook a thorough dismantling of its import-substitution motivated industrial policy and increased the role of external trade in the economy, the Asian region is consid- ered to be relatively successful. The development strategy that came into dominance beginning in the 1980s, often called \u2018the Washington Consensus\u2019, was based on a fundamental scepticism regarding the capacity of the State sector to intervene effectively in developing specific sectors. The State was considered to have a limited capacity to specify which products would have the great- est impact on growth and structural transformation. Even more damaging was an argument that was attractive to the populist imagination: The State, by its nature, was portrayed as being subject to an inherent weakness in the arena of politically-charged decision making, including corruption, which suggested an inherent deficiency in State capacity to imple- ment development strategy. In light of the high social costs of State intervention and the many mistakes committed by State agencies during the import-substitution period, the proponents of the Washington Consensus have argued, the private sector would have to be relied upon in identifying the most promising sectors and developing them. Subjecting the private sector to the proper price ratios of outputs and inputs and eschewing subsidized finance for private investment would guarantee that the private sector would choose the correct \u2018winners\u2019 and internalize the cost of making mistakes if it made the mistake of choos- ing \u2018losers\u2019. Only in this way can societies ensure a sustainable development path, it has been argued, embracing the view that industrial policy is a grievous mistake to be avoided. The failure to experience growth, much less structural change, particularly in Latin America, where countries had \u2018gotten their macroeconomic and trade regimes much closer to the idealized consensus than the Asian countries\u2019,12 has revived interest in industrial pol- icy. From a mainstream economic analysis, there are three bases for why the Washington Consensus developmental approach of relying on price signals to private investment is misleading. The first is the existence of dynamic scale economies and knowledge spillovers. Second, some agency, such as the State, might be needed to address coordination failures in private investment activities. Third, there are important informational externalities in the process of industrial investment. These three bases constitute the failings of private agents when restricted to mar- ket-mediated interactions. The underlying framework generates policy prescriptions that restore the equilibrium outcomes that would have been achieved if these failures did not 11 See also Tables A3\u2013A7 for the breakdown of world high-technology industry production by country and by subsec- tors. 12 Pack and Saggi (2006).

The mainstream view is based on a view that the gap between an ideal social outcome and the actual situation is definable in a non-controversial way and measureable; this is why the notion of equilibrium is indispensable. An alternative view, to which we now turn, is that structural change is by nature a disequilibrium process. 2.2 Schumpeterian innovation patterns and industry structure (firm size based innovation theories) Schumpeter\u2019s (1934, 1942) studies on the patterns of capitalist growth provide the starting point of an alternative stream of analysis of industrial development. This framework sees development as a turbulent and cumulative process. Instead of measuring the development gap against a \u2018faith-based\u2019 putative optimum, this framework relies on analysing gaps in productive and institutional capabilities among existing countries, industries, and firms. The Schumpeterian approach emphasizes the role of competition among production agents and among nations. Differences in technological and organizational capacity determine the competitiveness of countries, production sectors, and firms. Development involves the replacement of less competitive production units by more competitive production units, at a higher level of technology and at a larger scale. Used in a context at variance with the definition above, Schumpeter\u2019s phrase \u2018creative destruction\u2019 has achieved a \u2018romantic\u2018 status as a description of an idyllic state of economic affairs. In the mainstream framework, the elimination of any firm as a result of its inability to compete against foreign imports is an instance of creative destruction. Nothing new needs to be created in the process; the emphasis is on destruction and the ability to destroy is the basis of the creativity of the market. There is also no need to determine if the failed firm had a superior technology to the firms that produced the imports that destroyed it. However, the mainstream application is not consistent with Schumpeter\u2019s conception of \u2018creative destruc- tion\u2019. The word \u2018creative\u2019 has equal billing in the Schumpeterian process. Creative destruction only happens when something more advanced technologically or at a larger scale replaces an existing production activity. Schumpeterian economists have a more practical view\u2014new products, new produc- tion processes, new firms have to emerge if creative destruction is to occur. The closure of State-protected, State-subsidized firms could be destruction, but it is not creative, unless it is accompanied by the emergence of new economic activities with greater technological capability and the creation of possibilities to increase scale in the long run. Providing finan- cial assistance to firms to help them adjust to import liberalization programmes without requiring technological upgrading would signify a less destructive intent but would not be inherently creative in the Schumpeterian sense. Particularly in line with export-led in- 10 dustrialization strategies in developing economies, governments implemented a variety of measures to maintain the international competitiveness of the industries in which they had \u2018comparative advantage\u2019. The distribution of investment certificates, the provision of lower priced intermediate inputs produced by State economic enterprises, tax rebates and pref- erential interest rates in duty free importing opportunities, and the deregulation of labour markets exemplify such measures. Active State policy, not just the passive provision of incentives for the private sector, is critical for industrial restructuring. In the case of Turkey, these kinds of State-provided benefits, while easing the impact of external competition, did not necessarily result in a greater incentive to invest for technological upgrading or even for investment in general (Memi\u015f 2007). Memi\u015f (2007) demonstrates that contrary to conventional expectations, the export performance of Turkish manufacturing was not found to lend itself to productivity increases, and could not be sustained as a viable strategy of export-led growth. Even though there was a high growth in exports these were based on an export structure that was highly dependent on imports. The share of both public and private investment in manufacturing share declined significantly after the implementation of the structural adjustment pro- gramme, which included trade liberalization and privatization. Particularly in the case of public investment, the share of investment eventually became negligible to a level probably representing only depreciation costs. This outcome was consistent with the effort to delib- erately shrink the size of the public sector, in general, and the policy stance that considered industrialization to be no longer part of an export-led growth strategy, in particular. On the other side, the reason for the poor record of private investment is usually explained as the result of financial liberalization.

Whenever there was a moderate recovery observed in private investment, this was mainly due to a rise in domestic demand and to a decrease in the price of imported capital goods as a result of the appreciation of the local currency (Memi\u015f 2007: 47). Schumpeterian economists busy themselves with understanding the way in which innovation, which replaces less competitive activities, occurs. They are concerned with pat- terns in changes in products and production methods. They analyse the different speeds at which new ideas are implemented and the trends in declining cost of production through the life cycle of a product. In the Schumpeterian framework, there are three main theories of innovation: firm- based theories, industry life cycle theories and \u2018new evolutionary theories\u2019 (Keklik 2003: 157). Firm-based theories emphasize the role of the firm in the process of innovation and technological propagation. Competitive pressures compel firms to constantly reform their methods of production and change their product lines. Are smaller firms more innovative than larger firms? The answer depends on how \u2018new\u2019 a product is and the structure of the market for the product. Industry life cycle theories emphasize the implications of important phases of the de- velopment of an industry\u2014from invention to standardization, to maturity. New evolutionary theories call attention to the product specificity of innovation and industry development 11 patterns. \u2018Appropriability\u2019, which pertains to market conditions that permit innovators to ap- propriate returns from their profits, has a parallel in \u2018informational externality\u2019 of mainstream economics. However, appropriability is a broader concept, which can encompass situations of \u2018super profits\u2019 to first movers. Another key factor is basic capabilities in modern technol- ogy. This aspect calls for investments in basic skills, technical training, and the funding of research. The sustainability of basic training and research through commercial application is a key social question, which both State and private actors have to address. Another key concept is cumulativeness. The competitiveness of a firm or a nation depends on the stock of built-up capabilities. The development of technology and capability is path-dependent. While haphazard trade liberalization poses the danger that inherited capabilities will be dismantled, market forces cannot guarantee that these lost capabilities will be redeployed in other sectors in the national economy. While the mainstream view is based on a fundamental faith in an abstractly imagined \u2018private sector\u2019 that will search out the best investments in response to the \u2018right prices\u2019, the Schumpeterian analytical approach focuses on the life-and-death struggles of actual firms, both private and public, which embody capabilities and exploit both economic and political advantages for their survival and growth. Shapiro (2006: 8) formulates the alternative view as follows: In contrast to the passive price-taking firms of comparative statics, this literature portrays successful firms as those that create and maintain barriers to entry and the rents associated with them. By exploiting \u2018competitive\u2019 advantages based on innovation, firms are then not dependent on unsustainable cost advantages such as low wages or exchange rates. In contrast to the mainstream view, the State\u2019s developmental role must involve the promotion of increased production capability of national firms and the management of private rents, ensuring that they are channelled to social ends. In the advanced countries, the private sector provides the bulk of financing for research and development (R&D). Table 1 indicates that in Japan, the private sector provided 73.9 percent of R&D funding in 2002 while the government contributed 18.2 percent, and higher education, which is mostly State-supported, provided 6.5 percent. Public sector involvement is greater in France where the underlying participation of the public sector in industry is also higher.

Science and Engineering Indicators 2006. Notably, in the US, direct government contribution to R&D was as high as 31 percent of the total in 2003. The figures in Table 1 suggest that advanced countries themselves invest in R&D not because they can afford to, but because they cannot afford not to do so. Being cut off from the potential applications of the results of basic research represents a clear danger in terms of losing industrial competitiveness in the world economy. Hausmann and Klinger (2006) map technology possibilities in terms of the proximity of related technologies and suggest that having an economy whose production activities are too \u2018far away\u2019 from other technologies is a key indicator of poor international competitiveness. Moreover, a large por- tion of technological knowledge is tacit, which means that it is not possible to buy all the technological capability off the shelf (Hausmann and Rodrik 2006). Domestic investment in technological development is therefore indispensable, if only to create the domestic capability to absorb the \u2018tacit\u2019 content of technology from overseas. In the 1950s and 1960s and at a lower level of technology, the State in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan (Privince of China) found it necessary to intervene to assist its textile manufacturers attain competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis the textile industry of Japan in order to themselves be competitive exporters of garments, instead of being dependent on imports 13 of Japanese textiles. The key aspect of technological advance in a large number of cases is production capability and project execution capability, not the invention of new materials and processes. In Southeast Asia particularly, some specific projects undertaken in the name of industrial policy have been controversial. Mention can be made here of the Proton car proj- ect, of Malaysia the aircraft manufacturing associated with former Indonesian president B. Habibie, and the 11 major industrial projects13 associated with the final years of the Marcos regime in the Philippines. Specific evaluation of the nature of the drawbacks is beyond the scope of this paper. Industrial policy projects, because they often require the rechanneling of significant tax revenues and projects, are easily criticized as mainly fulfilling the \u2018vanity\u2019 of its proponents or as costly expressions of nationalism. While vanity is a legitimate category of political argument, the interest in this paper is to set out the key conceptual issues in evaluating a public policy that is implemented by States in a variety of ways. As in other public programmes, the necessary consideration in evaluating these programmes would be costs or net benefits. Specific industrial projects, such as these, are typically accompanied by specific costing of projects [for example, see Table 4 in Dohner and Intal (1989) for the costing of the above-mentioned 11 major industrial products in the Philippines]. It is important, as in other public costing exercises, to ensure that all indirect costs are included. Even just considering direct costs, the costs of many other interventions tend not to be as comprehensively and explicitly estimated. For example, tax holidays for foreign investment constitute tax expenditure in terms of foregone tax revenues and these cost estimates are very rarely reported. In evaluating net costs or benefits, the design of the industrial policy project is im- portant. The Malaysia car project explicitly incorporated the need to have sufficient volume and the planning and implementation of the project included the development of export markets (notably Australia, Singapore, and the UK) from the very start. The East Asian industrial projects were designed and implemented at a particular time and in the particular context in the East Asian region\u2014when all the countries were searching to upgrade their industrial capacities (Browning 1981). In the same period, the Republic of Korea was undertaking its Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) programme. The integrated steel mill project and the materials industry that were established in the Republic of Korea at that time have become extremely successful. Because it had no existing capability, it is well-known that Koreans undertook a lot of \u2018shadow\u2019 training (with workers play acting before imaginary machines marked out on the ground) before the actual steel making equipment arrived. Social capability is critical to the success of industrial policy, just as it is for other social policies. Social capability is built up from project implementation experience, since it cannot be learned otherwise.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6936b1bb-d4eb-4311-bdae-5dca3a18749e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6936b1bb-d4eb-4311-bdae-5dca3a18749e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10082084e85a33573d47f3cb180c8600abd335a33f11aacea79a2eb2212d28c6"}, "3": {"node_id": "801f4e07-1488-4369-b909-68a7f4c08dd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb8668af57ffbbc1b41d94a72fa773d548100046d24b51561260d1a3838143f2"}}, "hash": "5ecaac186ac292203cc79596a88d84c2756978a3ad75f43629e34f43ed1036d8", "text": "Building social capability is a project of many years. In the case of the Philippine projects, quite apart from the abrupt disappear- ance of international financing with the onset of the global debt crisis after the Mexican 13 An integrated steel mill and a copper smelting plant were two of the 11 projects. 14 default of 1982, the industrial policy projects were launched two years before the regime was overthrown. These projects also exemplify the dilemmas of specific product choices involved in industrial policy. Should Malaysia have sought, as it did, to build a complete car, instead of becoming competitive in automobile parts? In technical terms, certain automotive parts require more advanced technology and are subject to more rapid change, but this is the kind of choice of capability building that has to be made. Malaysia\u2019s foreign partner, Mit- subishi, withdrew as the project stabilized and the project has not succeeded in finding an alternative foreign partner. In the meantime, there has been renewed interest on the part of other foreign companies to start up automobile manufacturing production in Malaysia. In Indonesia, the specific choice of the propeller-driven aircraft, the \u2018NS250\u2019, is another example which speaks to choice of technology, and the size and location of markets. Evaluating the upgrading of domestic capabilities and technological externality are important ingredients in the choice of projects. Undertaking industrial development proj- ects in order to boost domestic demand or to increase access to foreign capital and lending have often proved counterproductive. It is more effective to choose specific projects as a part of an overall industrial plan, assuming that the government is willing to undertake explicit industrial policy. 2.3 Investment and industrialization In both the mainstream and alternative approaches, investment plays a critical role, since it is the means by which new activities and new capabilities emerge. In the mainstream view, with the private sector in the lead, the financing of investment\u2014the securing of savings and the decision to invest them\u2014is theoretically a separate activity, even if it takes place within the same firm. Because, at least hypothetically, investing is viewed as a separate activity, the development of domestic financial sectors is a well-defined policy objective in the main- stream view. Establishing a private financial sector, increased access to foreign finance, and increased capability to evaluate, design, and package the funding of development projects is critical, according to this view. Keynesian-style macroeconomics, a deviation from the laissez faire framework of that era and which was born during the deep economic depression of the 1930s, begins from a view that in a growing economy the act of savings, i.e. the act of setting aside the resources for investment, cannot be divorced from the decision to invest. In its simplified version, Keynesian macroeconomic models take investment as an exogenous variable, determined outside the system. The level of investment determines growth, and the level of savings is determined at the end of the whole process, instead of at the start. Economies that are not growing are so not because they do not have sufficient savings to invest, but because investment opportunities are too limited to encourage private actors to set aside resources to invest in them. Providing a \u2018climate\u2019 that motivates the private sector to maintain high rates of investment becomes a responsibility of the public sector. 15 In the 1980s, when trade liberalization became the dominant economic strategy in developing countries, the rate of investment stagnated or fell14 perceptibly, except in the East Asian countries (APTII 2005). Economic growth rates have consequently been lower during this period. 2.3.1 Composition of investment It is not only the level of investment that is critical. It is also important that investment in future production be directed towards the sectors that have the best potential for long-term growth and structural transformation. Worldwide, high technology industries have been growing much faster than other manufacturing activities (Table 2). Trade in high technol- ogy industries also shows higher growth rates compared to all manufacturing industries (Table 3). Poor countries that seek to grow faster at the same time as they integrate with the international economy must find a path to higher technology production, recognizing that they must push off from an inherited set of capabilities and domestic enterprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "801f4e07-1488-4369-b909-68a7f4c08dd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "801f4e07-1488-4369-b909-68a7f4c08dd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10082084e85a33573d47f3cb180c8600abd335a33f11aacea79a2eb2212d28c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "6936b1bb-d4eb-4311-bdae-5dca3a18749e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ecaac186ac292203cc79596a88d84c2756978a3ad75f43629e34f43ed1036d8"}}, "hash": "cb8668af57ffbbc1b41d94a72fa773d548100046d24b51561260d1a3838143f2", "text": "Table 2: Average annual growth rate of world Industry production, by selected industry: Selected years, 1980\u20132003 (Percent) Industry and country/economy 1980- 1986- 1991- 1996- 2001- 2002- 1985 1990 1995 2000 2002 2003 All manufacturing industries 2.1 3.5 1.7 3.9 1.5 3.3 High technology industries 5.2 5.9 2.8 13.6 3.4 8.3 Aircraft 0.5 4.9 -3.8 4.2 -2.3 -0.1 Pharmaceuticals 3.6 6.2 3.5 4.8", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2de634ae-456d-4201-b104-66e44e921890": {"__data__": {"id_": "2de634ae-456d-4201-b104-66e44e921890", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24bd7330e35381d92a217511083ea00c5d7a5c546f2aa54251f545238522191b"}, "3": {"node_id": "59a3b087-8c91-4e83-b94e-89efdba3416c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e196f81b67f6c55a7061ca9ca8329522184d4f48cbb18800e5bc02034884e922"}}, "hash": "033620ae12d668da8e1bcfb170c3566a16b4d29f37f9346958d892ea27aa1c66", "text": "5.3 4.9 Office and computing machinery 13.7 9.1 6.8 19.8 -1.9 14.7 Communication equipment 9.9 7.6 5.8 23.4 7.7 9.2 Medical, precision, and optical instruments 3.7 2.8 0.5 3.4 -2.9 4.9 Other manufacturing industries 1.8 3.2 1.6 2.6 1.1 2.3 Source: OECD (2005).

Among African countries, there was a corresponding decline from 14.7 percent to 8.4 percent, and among developing countries in Latin America, from 22.6 percent to 16.4 percent. The Asian average showed a contrary trend, with an increase from 16.8 percent in the 1970s to 19.9 percent in the 1990s. 16 Table 3: Annual average growth rates in world industry exports and imports, by industry: 1980\u20132003 (Percent) Industry and country/economy 1980- 1986- 1991- 1996- 2001- 2002- 1985 1990 1995 2000 2002 2003 Exports All manufacturing industries 0.3 9.0 6.6 5.9 3.5 9.1 High technology industries 6.8 12.9 11.8 17.0 4.1 15.5 Other manufacturing industries -0.4 8.4 5.7 3.3 3.2 6.7 Imports All manufacturing industries 0.8 9.5 6.7 6.0 3.6 9.2 High-technology industries 7.3 13.2 12.1 18.1 5.7 16.3 Other manufacturing industries 0.1 8.9 5.8 3.2 2.7 6.4 Source: OECD (2005). Science and Engineering Indicators 2006. 2.3.2 Public versus private investment \u2018Few phrases elicit such strong reactions from economists and policy-makers as industrial policy\u2019 (italics in the original) (Pack and Saggi 2006: 2). In the last two decades, the debate on industrial development has revolved around the issue of whether the State should be involved in a significant way in economic investment. That the State should be involved in social investment\u2014health, education, and poverty reduction\u2014has been less controversial. Even in the case of social investment, the responsibilities of the State have been sacrificed in the pursuit of macroeconomic stability. Development Committee (2006), written by the staff from the IMF and the World Bank, indicate that there has been an overshooting in the reduc- tion of the State role in investment, particularly in the case of investment in basic infrastruc- ture. Insufficient State investment in basic utilities, roads, transportation, and port facilities has undermined the prospects for growth in many low- and middle-income developing countries. Infrastructure investment is a basic component of industrial development. For instance, in a study of the initial and long-run effects of public investment expenditure on economic growth, relative to the effects of private investment, over the period 1970\u20131990 for 48 developing countries, Odedokun (1997) suggests that infrastructural public invest- ment facilitates private investment, especially in the long run. Odedokun (1997) also finds that the long-term effects of public investment tend to be much more positive than the short-term effects on growth, efficiency, and private investments. The question of whether the State should be involved beyond social and infrastructure investment is fraught with controversy. While State spending for basic research can be justified on the grounds of underpro- vision, each society has to design the scale and the approach of such investment. A second ground is related to the issue of coordination failure. The need to coordinate investment, when each of the private parties involved is separately unable to recover their individual investment, is demonstrated in Murphy et al. (1989). State involvement in investment was not only a very crucial part of industrialization, as was the case in the Latin American coun- tries and, even more so, in the East Asian countries. The provision of intermediate products was a key role played by State corporations in supporting export sectors by supplying these 17 sectors with cheaper inputs for those strategies launched in late 1970s and 1980s in many developing countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59a3b087-8c91-4e83-b94e-89efdba3416c": {"__data__": {"id_": "59a3b087-8c91-4e83-b94e-89efdba3416c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24bd7330e35381d92a217511083ea00c5d7a5c546f2aa54251f545238522191b"}, "2": {"node_id": "2de634ae-456d-4201-b104-66e44e921890", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "033620ae12d668da8e1bcfb170c3566a16b4d29f37f9346958d892ea27aa1c66"}}, "hash": "e196f81b67f6c55a7061ca9ca8329522184d4f48cbb18800e5bc02034884e922", "text": "Import liberalization, which was a cornerstone of the development strategy in the 1980s, has led to a dismantling of the significant State role in investment in intermediate goods production.

The Taiwanese approach, consisting of \u2018licensing foreign technologies, negotiating the licensing on behalf of Taiwanese firms, and granting subsidies to encourage local firms to enter high technology markets\u2019 (Fuller 2002: 2), was circumscribed by the tightness of the State budget constraint for these types of interventions. 2.4 Globalization and industrialization Since the 1980s, external trade as a proportion of output of developing countries has in- creased to a large extent because of the widespread adoption of outward-oriented develop- ment strategies. For developing countries as a group, the level of exports15 of goods and services as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP) increased from 21 percent in the 1970s to 29.6 percent in the 1990s. Imports increased faster, from 19.7 percent in the 1970s to 30.2 percent16 in the 1990s. These proportions were stagnant for Africa but dramatically increased in both Latin America and Asia. The experience of the last 25 years indicates that the growth rate of exports, even manufactured exports, is a poor indicator of the role of trade in economic development. Instead the growth of manufacturing value-added (MVA) is a more suitable indicator. In the 1990s, Mexico\u2019s manufactured exports grew at an annual rate of 30 percent. However, \u2018its corresponding growth rate of MVA did not exceed 4 percent as against an average of 7.5 percent for Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore\u2019 (Shafaeddin 2005: 165, Table 2.1). 15 Figures taken from APTII (2005), Tables 5 and 6. 16 The more rapid increase in imports is consistent with a greater incidence balance-of-payments difficulty, increasing debt burdens, and an increased import elasticity of growth in many developing countries. 18 Industrial policy is required in order to productively attract and utilize foreign invest- ment, as illustrated by the recent experience of the Latin American countries. Latin America has seen more foreign direct investment (FDI) per capita than other regions (Ocampo 2003), but continues to lag behind in technology. Since the beginning of the 1990s, most of the FDI to Latin America has flowed into the services sector rather than manufacturing (except in Bolivia where 60 percent of FDI is to primary resources based sectors) (Table 4). When an economy serves as an export platform, foreign investment can improve a country\u2019s interna- tional competitiveness, based on conventional measures. Investments into new productive activities are known to have generally greater human development impact than investment through mergers and acquisitions. However, if these investments have weak linkages with the local economy, a successful export policy will not be followed by the development of the local industrial base, as has been the case in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Honduras (Ocampo 2003: 10).

Two Latin American countries, Argentina and Chile, followed a different pattern in focusing on FDI in natural resource extraction or in manufactures based on natural resources. These types of investment can contribute to increased domestic value-added, while still not providing self-reinforcing linkages to local industry. While this approach ap- pears to be moderately successful, the share of these types of products in world trade is declining. Countries that rely too heavily on such a strategy have to exert greater effort to improve their international competitiveness because for those products whose markets are not expanding, increasing market share requires taking away the share of other countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01d72de3-2cf1-4e6e-9fac-225aa0d87cc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "01d72de3-2cf1-4e6e-9fac-225aa0d87cc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ccdd62907379fd9fc5dd05a9095d5221d017850a5927eb8099b46feb07f72df"}, "2": {"node_id": "cdd80e11-124a-46db-86ae-36ca3c9bb491", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e5b3ba8925788c897f85164fb12acebe298b442cb243cf6956eae1c6ac26827"}}, "hash": "1c42185328b430a61819ca647f95f4894dfa8733a339562fe7ee034b78b373fe", "text": "A further difficulty is that the outputs of investments in natural resource extraction have been vulnerable to large price swings, which have strong macroeconomic impact on the domestic economy.

Upgrading would benefit the systemic competitiveness of the economy, even though the actual results indicate that, in terms of quality and cost, these services are not yet close to 19 international best practice. Investment into services does not directly generate an increase in exports. Weak regulatory and competition policies in the receiving countries, often aggravated by defects in privatization programmes, could increase a receiving country\u2019s vulnerability to balance-of-payments difficulties. While FDI has a potentially valuable role in technological upgrading, it is important, however, that domestic policy is geared to take advantage of technological opportunities. Lall (2000) emphasizes the point that the \u2018localization\u2019 of foreign technology requires much more than a passive opening up to the entry of foreign investment. Liberalization can lead to the freezing of domestic comparative advantage. Technology does not transfer automati- cally as a result of opening up to foreign trade and capital flows since it is not completely embodied in machines, documented in licences, or residing in specific people. Time, invest- ment, and effort are required by the receiving country to understand, adapt, and use the technology in building new domestic capabilities. These kinds of efforts are normally subject to pervasive market failures, even within firms and certainly much more in private markets. Overcoming these failures require proactive policies on the part of the government. 20 3.1 Investment accumulation, and growth Successful East Asian industrializers have relied on an \u2018export-investment\u2019 nexus (Aky\u00fcz et al. 1999: 9). Industrial policy, particularly in the Republic of Korea, implicitly guaranteed high rates of return to private companies based on meeting export targets. The previous discussions suggest that domestic investment and domestic technologi- cal upgrading are critical to industrialization. Opening to external markets and capital is not a sufficient condition for either greater investment or technological upgrading and might not even be a necessary condition. If a country were to accept the objective of competing globally, it would be necessary that the technology of those activities competing externally be near the \u2018best practice\u2019 level (Lall 2000). Efforts to come closer to best practice have to contend with increasing returns to scale, strong agglomeration economies, and market and coordination failures. 3.1.1 Investment\u2013profit nexus In East Asia, the actual industrial policy utilized was such that, through a combination of policies, including protection from foreign competition and financial subsidies, the State guaranteed a higher-than-normal rate of return for economic activities identified as priority sectors. The State monitored the application of these \u2018super profits\u2019 to ensure that these would be reinvested in expanded output and/or better technology and lower costs. This strategy was necessitated by the absence of broad financial markets at the start of development, but, through the strong motivation for internal reinvestment, it also permitted enterprises to take advantage of scale economies to attain international competitiveness in the sectors that they participated in. In the longer run, state control over the investment\u2013profit nexus, which required that profits to be directly invested in greater output or better technology in targeted sectors, prevented the natural development of private domestic financial markets. In exchange for a possibly premature sophistication in the financial industry, these countries achieved increasing labour productivity and international competitiveness. Aky\u00fcz (1996) characterized this process as the \u2018management of economic rents\u2019. As Chang (1996) points out, State leadership is necessary in order to avoid the danger that in the long run the State-created advantages of industrial policy would weaken entrepre- neurship and hamper productivity growth. An important consideration is that in the case of industrial products that are meant for world markets, the number of enterprises that could competitively participate would be quite limited. Whether or not mediated by the State, 3. Trade, investment and growth 21 the existence of rents would be unavoidable in any process of entering new industries. The policy question that arises is whether the private sector on its own, responding to market forces, can reinvest sufficiently to sustain competitiveness and its technological position. Especially when enterprises are small and inexperienced relative to international competi- tors, it is likely that a State role in the investment\u2013profit nexus is indispensable. 3.1.2 Jobless versus employment enhancing growth The widespread liberalization of trade lies behind the significant expansion of trade and capital flows in the last three decades. This expansion, coupled with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, has considerable implications for global labour markets. \u2018The total number of workers producing for goods alone rose from around 300 million in 1980 to almost 800 mil- lion at the turn of the millennium (Aky\u00fcz 2006b: 1).

Many of the new entrants to the global goods market, including China and India, produce with lower capital inputs. With the entry of these producers, the global capital\u2013labour ratio could have fallen by as much as 50 percent. The expansion of trade and the accompanying expansion of the global labour force participating in world trade tend to disadvantage labour. Production with less capital means lower productivity and lower wages. Moreover, there is an increased intensity of competi- tion among workers in the global goods market. In comparison with the previous period, the current era of more liberalized trade is characterized by inadequate level of capital formation at the national level to absorb the unemployed in developing countries (Somel 1996). Increased trade has not necessar- ily translated into increased investment in developing countries. The drawing into global markets of workers from developing countries is not necessarily associated with increased international integration of national labour markets. A significant proportion of export goods are produced in production enclaves. Within a global regime in which labour mobility is highly restricted, developing country governments are unable to avoid the question of how international integration will impact the stability of domestic employment and the growth of household earnings. Under the current rules of globalization, industrial policy is not just a question of industrial choice and development but also that of sustaining incomes for the majority of the local population. Recent research17 indicates that even in East Asia, the employment elasticity of the growth in trade has declined significantly. The phenomenon of jobless growth afflicts even successful exporting countries. The key dilemma facing policy-makers is that created by succeeding at winning export markets at the cost of maintaining low investment, low wages, and poor employment growth at the national level. In order to translate successes at global integration into more productive employ- ment and higher household incomes, either the market in its natural state or the State has to promote backward linkages between externally related activities and the rest of the 17 Some references to research on \u2018jobless growth\u2019 in UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (2006). 22 economy. Efforts to increase value addition in commodity exporting sectors suggest that the State has an indispensable role to stimulate forward linkages and to assist the private sector in identifying the financing necessary for the effort. Industrial policy as a way to set priorities in this regard is the duty of any State committed to reducing poverty. In Asia, the number of jobs created fell from 337 million in the 1980s to 176 million in the 1990s (Palanivel 2006), in a period when both trade and growth were accelerating. The reduction in job creation was particularly severe in the East Asian sub-region, which is generally recognized as the most \u2018competitive\u2019 internationally and the region that received the greatest increase in foreign investment. In East Asia, 273 million new jobs were created in the 1980s, while in the 1990s only 104 million were created. The employment elasticity of growth fell from 0.56 percent in the 1980s to 0.15 percent in the 1990s (Palanivel 2006). In South Asia, there was an increase from 64 million new jobs created in the 1980s to 72 million in the 1990s. This pattern underlines the impact of international competitive pressures on the industrial development of developing countries, particularly those that rely heavily on international trade. The labour intensity of manufacturing declined steeply in East Asia, especially for China and Malaysia (UNIDO 2004), through changes in the kinds of products produced by the sector. Competitive pressures arising from relying on foreign markets also induced changes in the production technology toward greater capital intensity. As will be discussed in the following section, national competitiveness is not measured in terms of export growth or the balance of trade, but in the rising productivity, particularly of the labour force, and domestic living standards. Increased capital intensity of manufactur- ing will increase the productivity of the employed labour force, but not necessarily of the national labour force. In the extreme case, though this did not happen in East Asia, there would be no increase in national labour force productivity if there were large job losses as a result of changes in the manufacturing product mix and/or diminished labour intensity.

In fact, reversing the sharp reorientation away from labour-intensive manufacturing experienced in the 1990s, should it be desirable, will require industrial policy. Increased international protectionism or lower global growth in the next decade could make industrial policy not only desirable but unavoidable. 3.2 International competitiveness There are three levels of international competitiveness\u2014at the level of the firm, industry, and the nation. For the firm and the industry, competitiveness is the ability to deliver products and services as or more effectively and efficiently than other firms and other industries. If the product is traded internationally, the relevant competitors are international. At the level of industry, competitiveness depends on the effectiveness of production networks among firms in the domestic industry and/or with other firms internationally. Firms have the first and foremost responsibility for their own competitiveness, which depends on their tech- 23 nological choices, their deployment of profits, and policies toward the raising of firm-level productivity. Individual firms cannot attribute their uncompetitiveness to failures of State policy; it is not the responsibility of the State to guarantee the competitiveness of any firm. In the Schumpeterian framework, one reason for the uncompetitiveness of firms is the lack of competition in the aspects of technology and productivity. In markets with decreasing costs and tendencies toward monopolization, State policies to force competitive behaviour to improve productivity are necessary. Depending on the structure of the industry, this could require competition policy and regulations against price collusion or the promotion of mergers among firms, either subsequently regulated by the State or required to export their production, in order to better exploit economies of scale. At the industry level, competitiveness is the ability of the country\u2019s firms to success- fully deliver products and services compared to similar industries in other countries without protections or subsidies. One indicator of the competitiveness of an industry is its trade balance as an industry; another is the level of inflow of foreign investment into the industry. Industry competitiveness depends on the effectiveness of networks among domestic firms and the effectiveness of State industrial policy. Competitiveness can be said to improve if the level of protection and subsidy required for competing against foreign entities declines. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 1997: 1) pro- vides a generally accepted definition of national competitiveness: National competitiveness refers to a nation\u2019s ability to produce, distribute, and ser- vice goods in the international economy in competition with goods and services produced in other countries, and to do so in a way that earns a rising standard of living. The ultimate measure of success is not a \u2018favorable\u2019 balance of trade, a posi- tive current account, or an increase in foreign exchange reserves: it is an increase in the standard of living.18 Rising wages and higher standards of living are therefore the key indicators of a country\u2019s competitiveness. National competitiveness does not require competitiveness in every industry; what is needed is a configuration of industries that permits rising productiv- ity that is translated into higher living standards. In line with the recent emphasis on diminishing returns industries in line with con- ceptions of competitiveness arising from the Washington Consensus, competitiveness has recently been associated with low wage costs. Maquila industries or industries in export processing zones are able to supply products in international markets mainly through the use of low cost labour in developing countries. These successes do not indicate national competitiveness, based on the OECD definition, and could unnecessarily encourage State policies to be oriented toward maintaining low domestic wages in the name of national competitiveness. 18 See Scott (1985: 14\u201315). 24 3.2.1 Links between unit labour costs, income distribution, and accumulation The analysis of unit labour costs has become the dominant approach in analysing the international competitiveness of countries. This section exposes the weaknesses of this ap- proach. It provides a measure of the cost of labour deflated by the productivity of labour; higher unit labour costs would be associated with reduced international competitiveness under the view that these costs increase the domestic cost of production. Higher wages could still be consistent with lower unit costs if the productivity of labour is correspondingly higher. In making cross-country comparisons, unit labour costs is the product of two ele- ments, namely the ratio of labour cost to productivity, which can be called the \u2018pure\u2019 effect, and the \u2018price adjustment\u2019 effect, which derives from the overall domestic inflation adjusted to exchange rate effects (Felipe 2005a). In the case of the \u2018pure\u2019 effect, the cost of labour per unit is the wage rate and labour productivity is measured as output per unit of labour input.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9ac03a3-172f-4b08-86f8-0ff6ac850311": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9ac03a3-172f-4b08-86f8-0ff6ac850311", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b6dd72e3c525ab7721b59d66e41b2247e480fc6496ccd445a2e8f8a94c80a13"}}, "hash": "1b6dd72e3c525ab7721b59d66e41b2247e480fc6496ccd445a2e8f8a94c80a13", "text": "At the very basic level, unit la- bour cost is therefore the ratio between the wage rate and output per worker. This quantity is numerically equivalent to the share of the value of output that is devoted to wage payments (Felipe 2005b). Using unit labour costs as the sole indicator of competitiveness thus associ- ates with the increasing share of output of one of the factor inputs, labour, and the whole weight of a country\u2019s international competitiveness. In developing countries, and in fact in most economies, there are many other important inputs\u2014notably capital and land, which are remunerated by profits and rent. This leads to the question of why the increasing shares of these other factors should not also be associated with increasing cost of production and affecting international competitiveness. A higher labour share need not be associated with a less competitive economy. Given the equivalence, there might as well be a measure of unit capital cost, which would associate the responsibility for competitiveness to capital. Felipe (2005a) demonstrates that in the case of the Philippines, the capital share has been increasing much more rapidly than the labour share. This indicates that, aside from price and exchange rate effects, Philippine losses in international competitiveness might be more easily associated with increased profit margins, instead of increased labour costs. If competitiveness is dependent on unit labour costs, the fact that this measure is equivalent to the wage share means that competitiveness, instead of being a purely technical cost concept, is determined by social relations, which in all societies, social relations control the distribution of the total value of production among the different factors of production. Careful and comprehensive19 measurement of unit labour costs suggests that the labour share in the value of output in developing countries could be about the same, or only slightly lower, as that in developed countries, where this share fluctuates around 70 percent. This discussion underlines the importance of understanding the impact of wage and capital shares on overall growth, even within the narrow ranges in which they might fluctuate. An increase in the wage share could increase domestic consumption and overall economic growth, and through the accelerator, investment. An increase in capital share could also increase investment, and through increased investment, long-term growth. 19 The cost of informal labour and earnings of the otherwise self-employed is often not incorporated in the estimates of labour payments. 25 3.2.2 Wage growth as an indicator of the performance of industrial policy The analysis of the patterns of wage growth provides a potential measure of the success of industrial policy. If workers earn industry-specific rents, which can be observed through wage payments (Katz and Summers 1989; Galbraith and Calmon 1990), then wage patterns would track the relative performance of industries among countries. For this, the analysis of the evolution of the wage patterns in each country by different industry groups is required. As a result, the change in wages must reflect the changing relative performance of industries (Galbraith and Kim 2001). Based on this framework, constantly rising wage rates would be consistent with increasingly rising rents in the corresponding industry. The authors have used industry groupings according to the OECD\u2019s (1997) method for classifying the OECD countries\u2019 industrial sectors and manufactures by level of technol- ogy (see Table A1 in Annex A). As the main data source, the Industrial Statistics Database of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is used. The authors have used 2003 data. The most recent data available is 2004, but it is not available for the range of countries that were selected for the study. The authors also believe, as evident in the subsequent graphs, that the industrial data of considerable interest is reasonably stable. This database provides information on number of establishments, employment, wages and sala- ries, output, value added, gross fixed capital formation, number of female employees, and production indexes by country and year at the 3-digit level of ISIC (Rev. 2), which includes 29 industries in the manufacturing sector from 1976 to 2003 (the length of the time series differs among countries due to problems in data availability). Figures 1\u20134 present yearly wages per employees in low-technology (low-tech.), medium\u2013low technology (medium\u2013low tech.), medium\u2013high technology (medium\u2013high tech.), and high-technology (high-tech.) industries respectively in five countries, namely Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. A common pattern observed in all the figures is that wage patterns in the Republic of Korea exhibit the most dynamic pattern among all the countries in the sample.

A comparison of the real wage trends of the Re- public of Korea against different regions of the world beyond the Southeast Asian countries can indicate where the Republic of Korea stands relative to the advanced economies such as in Europe. For this purpose the authors looked at the trends in real wages in different regions over time and juxtaposed them with the Republic of Korea\u2019s real wage trends in high-technology and medium\u2013high technology industries. Figures 5 and 6 show the sub- stantive transformation in the structure of wages in the Republic of Korea, which cannot be observed anywhere else. Even though at the beginning of the period of analysis the Republic of Korea\u2019s real wage is at the same level as other countries in Southeast Asia, after the outstanding growth, particularly in the period following mid-1980s, the authors observe that the real wage level in Korean high-technology and medium\u2013high technology reaches almost up to the levels of real wage in the same sectors in countries such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain in the European region.21 In all the figures above, the authors observe that the real wage trends in the Republic of Korea by industry exhibit a different pattern compared to other countries in the South and Southeast Asian region as well as compared to other regions in the world. Following this first step, the next step is to statistically test whether the Republic of Korea can be singled out in terms of the structure of the wage patterns. If so, this could theoretically provide empirical evidence on the performance of the Korean industrial policy. It is important to mention here that finding evidence of an effective Korean industrial policy does not necessarily invalidate the effects of other historical forces. 20 The deficiencies of cross-country analysis have been criticized in the literature. The key problem is that cross-country estimates implicitly assume a common data structure across countries. This would invalidate inferences, particularly policy inferences when right-hand side variables are policy-determined. In our application, we compare across coun- tries, but do not need a common structure to all countries. Our analysis requires that the classification among high-, medium-, and low-technology sectors be reasonably comparable across countries. 21 See Table B2 in Annex B for the list of the countries included in region classification. The consideration in choosing these countries in the list was to include the ones with GDP growth rates similar to Korea, around 5 percent in the last decade on average. 29 Figure 5: Yearly wages per employee in high-tech. Industries: Selected countries and regions, 1978-1997 Figure 6: Yearly real wages per employee in medium-high tech. Industries: Selected countries and regions, 1976-1997 30 In order to detect the similarities and/or differences in the wage patterns through time the authors apply cluster analysis, a statistical tool introduced by Berner and Galbraith (2001) that permits one to identify the fundamental structure in time series data, based on patterns of behaviour over time. Its usefulness in this study comes from its ability to be applied to the rates of dispersion of the wage data over time. For the study\u2019s purposes, the authors chose the deviation of yearly wage cost per labour within each country from the weighted average of all the countries as the best possible indicator of different wage patterns. The percentage difference is useful because it provides a unit-free measure. The specific calculations on the data and the statistical clustering method are explained in Annex C. The results for high-technology industries confirm the observations in the figures above. Figure C1 shows the dendogram presenting the results of clustering analysis applied to high-technology industries. The wage pattern in the Republic of Korea is not grouped among any of the groups; rather it is singled out as carrying sufficiently different dynamics from the ones in other countries which are found to be clustered in three groups (Figure C1). 31 Industrial policy, like any other policy, is an outcome of a country\u2019s political economy, which could derive from many sources, including from the technical ambitions emanating from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ceeb422-2938-4305-beb6-0d6b7a90cce0": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ceeb422-2938-4305-beb6-0d6b7a90cce0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5178b333e061f0effa7277f139c23892a41f09d55607584c88279fdc22f5670"}}, "hash": "a5178b333e061f0effa7277f139c23892a41f09d55607584c88279fdc22f5670", "text": "(often a subset of) the government bureaucracy, from the net result of lobbying by different groups in the private sector, as political outcomes of legislation, and pressures from social groups such as farmers and workers. States could be unconsciously undertaking interven- tions that would appear to be industrial policy, as when they provide tax and tariff incentives to foreign investment. Such \u2018unconscious\u2019 industrial policy, justified as encouraging foreign investors to improve the efficiency of the whole economy, benefits specific sectors. Chang (1996: 89) suggests that industrial policy \u2018can be firmly anchored in economic theory if we\u2026take seriously the issues of institutional diversity and technical change\u2019. Indus- trial policy involves bureaucratic \u2018meddling\u2019 into economic processes; the standard view is that such intervention is unnecessary and harmful because markets are superior in \u2018choos- ing\u2019 the best outcomes by coordinating the decisions of many disparate parties through competition. However, the standard view depends on a set of assumptions that are rarely present. Coordination through competition within the market mechanism requires that the technology of participants be characterized by decreasing returns to scale, for example. Constant returns to scale or increasing returns to scale (which is quite prevalent in manu- facturing where there are significant fixed costs) impels all participants to each expand their production, not taking into account the output of others, resulting in losses for everyone in the industry and the exit of most participants. In real life, these kinds of vulnerabilities en- courage private actors to find a way to coordinate among themselves and, failing that, to call upon or acquiesce to the government regulation of entry and providing the means for more ex ante coordination. Because even this is often not sufficient to maintain orderly produc- tion at reasonable prices, government regulations have also played the role of restraining or augmenting profit-seeking behaviour. When the intervention of government through these mechanisms is completely the outcome of political pressures, these pressures, in effect, result in \u2018unconscious\u2019 industrial policy. If market competition is not an effective coordinator of production, perhaps it con- tributes \u2018dynamic\u2019 effects by releasing private sector energy for innovation. The argument for market competition, cited by Chang (1996: 72) is that even if the government is indispensable in solving the static coordination problem, its interference will stifle technological progress and obstruct the \u2018natural selection\u2019 of firms. Chang (1996) argues that the \u2018natural selection\u2019 metaphor is alluring except for the fact that, unlike biological natural selection, the firms 4. Political economy of industrial policy 32 22 Chang (1996) gives the example of the QWERTY keyboard arrangement, which is universally seen to be inferior to other proposed key arrangements. 23 Two examples of these are: (i) the videocassette recording format of Sony, which was technically superior but lost out to VHS and (ii) the original Microsoft disk operating system (DOS) for the IBM PC which was technically inferior to other operating systems at the time of its introduction. 24 In practice, these kinds of States are providing tariff and tax benefits to foreign investors. that are caught up in the process have the facility to consciously shape their participation in the selection process. Firms have the capacity to intentionally \u2018mutate\u2019, in the Schumpet- erian sense and to build upon existing advantages. These strategies could include capturing market dominance, which could be for an inferior22 technology.23 The interdependence among firms has been highlighted in recent years by competing groupings among private companies to set standards for various media formats, such as the format for the DVD, high definition TV, and so on. These negotiated standards are attempts at ex ante coordination within the private sector, a coordination that unfortunately the \u2018market\u2019 by itself is unable to furnish. Firms in those developing countries that have the ambition to integrate with the world economy have the additional burden of having to compete with the technological and market capabilities of global firms. Governments in these ambitious developing coun- tries risk the destruction of built-up domestic capabilities and decimation of the domestic private sector if they rely on external market competition to stimulate dynamic innovation. In the successful East and Southeast Asian countries, governments have been able to assist the domestic private sector in accessing foreign technology, coordinating entry and exit into industrial sectors, and moderating the role of foreign competition. As the domestic private sector, particularly those with significant roles in the economy, have greater access to State decision-making, governments have often found themselves implementing industrial policy of the unconscious kind.

The Japanese failed effort in stimulating \u2018Fifth Generation\u2019 computer technology, which was overtaken by advances in microprocessing, can be contrasted with the earlier maligned but ultimately successful Korean push into heavy and chemical industry (HCI) in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Often, even \u2018inadvertent\u2019 decisions can lead to a \u2018successful\u2019 outcome. Pack and Saggi (2006: 36), who are unsympathetic to \u2018pro-active\u2019 industrial policy, cite the case where nationalistic rules led to IBM\u2019s (the dominant manufacturer of mainframe computers) shutdown of Indian op- erations in 1977, which inadvertently forced domestic programmers to gain competence in UNIX, which could be run on more open and cheaper computer platforms. The government, which used to purchase half of all computers sold in India, also standardized on UNIX. When US firms migrated away from mainframe platforms, India found itself with a comparative advantage of providing programming in UNIX. The current dominant view is that that States should eschew having pro-active in- dustrial policy. This stance is politically convenient to the extent that it exempts States from having to referee among the competing segments within the private sector24 and having 33 to play a role in ensuring orderly markets in labour and essential goods. The reality is that States find themselves ensnared in industrial policy decisions, even after structural adjust- ment-motivated reform processes. The Turkish experience since the early 1980s, analysed in Memis (2007), illustrates this reality and the pressures. As a matter of political economy, the structural adjustment25 approach can be seen as a style of industrial policy that consciously upholds the decisive primacy of the private sector26 in technological development and in entry and exit in product markets, both do- mestic and global. Ideally, within this approach, structural changes in economic production and international economic integration are the outcome of individual private decisions. It is an approach that is sparing of State capability and susceptible to the type of coordination within the private sector discussed earlier in this section. The activity of industrial policy, when the State consciously chooses to be actively involved, is composed of (i) planning, identification, and strategy formation, (ii) implementa- tion (trade regime, subsidies, regulation of entry and exit), and (iii) evaluation and strategy adaptation. Capability in each of these activities needs to be created and built within the State. As explained earlier, even if the State does not have these capabilities, often private sector pressures require the State to make selective decisions. A robust private sector is an advantage, and there are important examples in which the private sector has been indis- pensable in the planning and identification stage (Pack and Saggi 2006: 40), when State support started only after some success in some sectors became evident. 25 This approach has metamorphosed into various versions, including \u2018enhanced structural adjustment\u2019, and \u2018poverty reduction strategy\u2019. 26 As can be seen in the Turkish case, this approach does not exempt the State from addressing the question of profit- ability and survivability of the domestic private sector. 34 Is industrial policy still feasible in the current technological context and within the inter- nationally agreed policy restrictions in the world trade system? Pack and Saggi (2006: 44) suggest that in the context of international production networks, rapidly changing product characteristics, and rapid innovation with dramatic declines in product prices, it \u2018may be beyond the competence of any government to help their domestic firms foresee and suc- cessfully deal with more than a small fraction of the unknowable changes that will affect their future\u2019. Other analysts, such as Shafaeddin (1998), take the opposite of this fatalistic view and emphasize the opportunities for selective intervention to assist domestic firms in inserting themselves into production networks (as Taiwan, or Province of China has dem- onstrated for a string of products) and in exploiting \u2018second mover\u2019 advantages in rapidly changing product configurations. These analysts do not assume that the private sector has an inherent advantage in knowledge about \u2018unknowable changes\u2019. Due to social demands on the State, emanating from both domestic and external sources, States in all levels of economic development undertake interventions to foster or hinder selective economic industries, as indicated earlier.

The need for new social capabilities Due to the international community\u2019s commitment, the policy space of States for MDG- directed interventions are relatively unhindered, even though there have recently been controversial macroeconomic questions regarding the extent to which aid-funded domestic 5. \u2018Powerless state\u2019: Myth or historical fact? 35 spending would be allowed to breach Poverty Reduction and Growth facility ceilings27 in sub-Saharan Africa. The policy space for industrial policy is being constrained by domestic reforms as elements of structural adjustment programmes (Chang 2005) and by interna- tional trade agreements. Sustained economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction. Since the Industrial Revolution in England, all historical experiences of sustained economic growth have relied on the rise and upgrading of a set of institutions, complementary behavioural norms, and public policies (Cimoli et al. 2006: 2). \u2018Discretionary public policies\u2019 were major ingredients of national development strategies, especially in the catching-up countries, throughout the history of modern capitalism. The current prescription is to focus on reforms in the legal system in developing countries to better approximate the structures of rights and responsibilities in Western countries. This focus ignores the need for the complemen- tary institutions and norms needed to make them effective. The Western legal system, which was also developed during the period when States were undertaking discretionary policies to pursue industrial policy, presupposes a particular relationship between the State and private markets that might not be appropriate for developing countries. Undertaking effec- tive industrial policy requires not only advances in the technological capabilities, but also improvements in institutions of State policy and norms of behaviour in the private sector. Industrial policy thus represents a challenge to existing domestic governance capabilities at the same time that it provides the opportunity to improve them. The standard analytical framework from economics neglects the \u2018dynamic processes related to innovation and learning when analysing economic growth and economic devel- opment\u2019 (Lundvall 2007: 2). Under the aegis of the OECD (1997), policy-makers in advanced industrial economies have explicitly considered approaches to promoting and managing innovation under the framework of \u2018national systems of innovation (NSIs), which refers to the network of institutions, including private firms and universities, and the regulatory framework (such as patent protection). Research in this area has concentrated on analysing existing NSIs, and understanding the reasons for their relative effectiveness between coun- tries. For developing countries, the discussion has \u2018to be shifted in the direction of system construction and promotion\u2019 (Lundvall 2007: 14), since in a catch-up mode, innovation policy needs to be a deliberate activity. Researchers in the field also suggest a better understand- ing of the role of power relationships in innovation systems to throw light on situations in which class privileges block learning opportunities and destroy existing competencies. For least developed countries and small island states it would be economical in shap- ing the development of institutions of research and universities to explicitly consider their role in the national system of innovation as part of industrial policy. These objectives should help them determine how to support the sending of scholars abroad and negotiate with industrial countries the kind of educational assistance and scholarships that are of high- est priority. Many small countries, such as in the Caribbean and the Pacific share university facilities. Based in its own vision of industrial upgrading, individual countries can consider developing specific areas of expertise grounded in their own industrial policy. 27 See IMF Independent Evaluation Office (2007). The ceilings are limits on government expenditure. 36 5.2 Policy space: A historical perspective Except possibly for a brief period in the decades following World War II, restrictions on policy space in developing countries have been quite widespread. During the colonial period, unequal treaties such as those obtained by Britain in Latin America (starting with Brazil in 1810) and China limited the maximum tariff rates (Chang 2005). Latin America regained tariff autonomy in the 1880s. The US\u2013Japan treaty of 1853 included a five percent maximum Japanese tariff rate; even though Japan was still subject to this restriction, it imposed the same kind of tariff", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52cc3c5d-efb2-434c-9e06-02045224f87a": {"__data__": {"id_": "52cc3c5d-efb2-434c-9e06-02045224f87a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "261bfa97f525a1c3a2129b04efb7e8449dcf3aa16b9adf8c39326afc3134cf7c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b23fed2-11a7-4884-8a70-5771ab40f04b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0efb2cd6b8188f35443963c56386f3d31013d716c09ea6df4ad01c8f4f21c1f3"}}, "hash": "df01b1fc99653393204c364ac57d938f13ca34bd802d409fe5f17ce5aac13a96", "text": "restrictions on the Republic of Korea when the latter became its colony. Countries such as China and Turkey were able to obtain tariff autonomy as late as in the late 1920s only. In addition, prohibitions against high value-added activities, such as those imposed by Britain on its American colonies, bans on exports of competing goods from colonial territories, and incentives to expand primary production were also part of the eco- nomic relations during the colonial period. Developing countries experienced their most rapid rates of growth in the 1960s and 1970s, a period associated with high tariffs and industrial protection. Per capita growth rates in the three percent range (compared to a rate of 1\u20131.5 percent over decades for countries participating in the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century) were quite common. Chang (2005) notes that the rate of economic growth of the Asian colonies and semi-colo- nies was much slower in the period 1900\u20131950. For example, the Bangladesh\u2013India\u2013Pakistan region and Indonesia grew at -0.1 percent during this period. After 1980, per capita growth rates have once again declined. A system of bilateral, regional, and multilateral (notably the World Trade Organization) trade treaties now shapes the system of international economic relations. Especially since the Uruguay Round of trade talks, there has been a marked trend of increasing restrictions on domestic policy space in developing countries (UNDP, RBF et al. 2003). These diminutions of policy space through international restrictions have also been justified as a necessary tool toward constricting a domestic elite from rapaciously expropriating and wasting28 a nation\u2019s resources. Submitting to international restrictions is certainly one possible tool to improve \u2018domestic governance\u2019, just as international treaties on human rights help to protect individuals through external standards. If development and economic markets were particularly free of imperfections, such as increasing returns to scale,29 and inherited disadvantages in capabilities that markets do not naturally address, this additional governance tool would not be harmful to development itself. If, however, the opposite would be the case, the prospects of development would be sacrificed at the altar of good governance. Governance weaknesses are best addressed through means that are themselves consistent with good governance\u2014such as expanded participation and improved mechanisms of transparency and accountability. Commitments by governments 28 This would be consistent with a weak or non-existent investment demand on the part of the domestic private sector, which could indeed be the case if the trade and industrial regime imposed enormous uncertainty on private investment. 29 As pointed out earlier, regulatory interventions are in fact necessary to prevent rent-seeking behaviour; restrictions on State intervention are, therefore, inappropriate. 37 in international agreements and in structural adjustment programmes when undertaken by a narrow constituency (such as the export sector) undermine progress in good governance. Good governance is also undermined when the conditions in these structural adjustment programmes are non-transparent, and the failures of the programmes do not result in politi- cal costs to policy-makers. In historical perspective, the developing country policy space first created after World War II, which has diminished since then, is still quite significant in comparison to the period before World War II. Amsden (2005), among others, has discussed how developing countries might find spaces to undertake industrial policy under the current WTO rules. 5.3 Multilateral rules on trade and investment limiting policy space The outcome of the Uruguay Round in 1994 introduced additional international commit- ments, which have the potential of restricting policy tools that had been applied to great success by late industrializers from Asia. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervail- ing Measures restricts targeted subsidies to domestic industries. This agreement prohibits subsidies to be paid to firms \u2018upon export performance\u2019 (except agricultural goods) or \u2018upon use of domestic over imported inputs\u2019 (Shafaeddin 2006: 10). The Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) agreement prohibits the use of \u2018performance requirements\u2019 on foreign investors such as local content, minimum export targets, and trade balances. With the extension of the principle of \u2018national treatment\u2019 to government procure- ment, the TRIMs Agreement limits \u2018national preference\u2019 for domestic products in government purchases. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) severely restricts the ability of developing countries to utilize foreign technology without compensation, except for social causes such as health objectives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b23fed2-11a7-4884-8a70-5771ab40f04b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b23fed2-11a7-4884-8a70-5771ab40f04b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "261bfa97f525a1c3a2129b04efb7e8449dcf3aa16b9adf8c39326afc3134cf7c"}, "2": {"node_id": "52cc3c5d-efb2-434c-9e06-02045224f87a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df01b1fc99653393204c364ac57d938f13ca34bd802d409fe5f17ce5aac13a96"}}, "hash": "0efb2cd6b8188f35443963c56386f3d31013d716c09ea6df4ad01c8f4f21c1f3", "text": "Rasiah\u2019s (2003) analysis of the Irish, Malaysian, and Singaporean experiences indicates quite forcefully that relying on FDI as a natural means of industrial upgrading is illusory and, therefore, States would need to retain tools to impose performance requirements on foreign investors to upgrade domestic skills and technology. 5.4 WTO subsidies agreement and policy space The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "933ee0ec-f198-4557-8f80-0917a538bd6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "933ee0ec-f198-4557-8f80-0917a538bd6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f75064b30357d0a9c12a32a2714021f2cb46b7a56ecb659cf90e81505dfecbc1"}}, "hash": "f75064b30357d0a9c12a32a2714021f2cb46b7a56ecb659cf90e81505dfecbc1", "text": "provides a categoriza- tion of the different kinds of subsidies and to some extent protects some policy space for countries to intervene in the areas of poverty reduction, technological development, and environmental improvement (Aguayo Ayala and Gallagher 2005).

The agreement recognizes three areas of market failure, the first being research and development. Governments can provide assistance to firms, to higher education, and to research agencies contracted by firms to research activities. The second area is regional development; all industries in a region30 can be subsidized as part of 30 Regions that can be subsidized cannot have per capita GDP more than 85 percent of the country average or must have unemployment rates over 110 percent of the country average, measured over a three-year period. 38 an overall regional development programme. The third area is the environment and permits government subsidies for upgrading facilities to conform to new environmental require- ments that impose financial burdens on firms. These subsidy exemptions were in place until the end of 1999. The revisiting of these exemptions was one of the conditions that develop- ing countries insisted upon in agreeing to the Doha development round. The possibility of re-authorizing these subsidies depends on the success of the current trade round. 5.5 The tradeoff between market access and policy space in bilateral and regional trade agreements The extensive reorientation of developing countries toward external markets has intensi- fied competition among these countries for access to developed country markets. Shadlen (2006) analyses how the pressure among Latin American countries to improve their access to the US market, in view of, and to make up for, their competitive disadvantage relative to the East Asian economies, has imposed a rush toward free trade negotiations/agreements with the US. Domestically, the export sectors in these Latin American countries provide strong pressure to accede to these agreements. These agreements, however, trade market access in exchange for a loss in policy space, since US bilateral agreements consistently require stronger intellectual property protection, access to key service sectors, such as the financial sector, and commitments to renounce certain policy instruments, such as capital controls in the case of the US\u2013Chile free trade agreement. These restrictions in policy space could lock-in the domestic structure into those sectors getting market access and cut off the possibilities for faster industrial upgrading. 39 6.1 Role of state in influencing the pace and path of capital accumulation The discussion in Section 2.3 identified the indispensable role that the State would have to play in investment and capital accumulation in addressing sectoral development and overcoming coordination failures in private markets. Even when determined to avoid it, governments often find themselves undertaking selective intervention to maintain orderly supply outcomes and in response to political pressure. Particularly in economies that have increased their engagement with the world economy, States are \u2018doomed to choose\u2019 31 pri- orities among firms and modern sectors in their economy. 6.1.1 Fiscal policies to channel profits into sustainable investments Maintaining strong and stable economic growth rates is necessary to sustain accumulation and investment. States have the duty to protect against financial instability and respond to boom\u2013bust cycles in capital flows (Aky\u00fcz 2006a: 46). States have to restore the tools and their role in utilizing fiscal policy with a countercyclical dimension. Over the economic cycle, States have to establish the capability to run deficits during contractions and store surpluses during expansions. Building a more diversified and buoyant tax system is vital. Putting in place macroprudential regulations is necessary to prevent excessive risk taking funded from external liabilities. For many States, a more active fiscal policy will require recovering fiscal autonomy and the elimination of chronic structural deficits. Aky\u00fcz (2006b) points out that, for many states, fiscal autonomy cannot be restored under the existing stock of debt and, therefore, there is a need for orderly programmes to reduce the burden of both the debt service and the potential instability that could arise due to a sudden stop in new financing and rollovers. 6.1.2 Policies at the sectoral level States in developing countries require rational principles to guide their sectoral interven- tions, to be able to respond to political pressures and market failures in a deliberate way. An industrial development plan that identifies priority sectors and the types of interventions that would be required is necessary. These plans have to be specific with regard to products. These plans have to recognize the implications of chosen priorities on how greater value- added and competitiveness can be achieved.

Hausmann and Klinger find that countries that have been growing slowly are those whose products have a large \u2018distance\u2019 from more advanced products. Sectoral industrial policy will involve a choice of products and sectors to reduce these gaps. At a level above the sectoral level, government management is indispensable in public investment and FDI. Decades of public investment cutbacks in the name of fiscal stabilization have resulted in glaring gaps in infrastructure (transportation and energy, for example) in many developing countries. Because of these shortfalls, domestic private investment is stymied, countries find domestic production internationally uncompetitive, and medium-term growth prospects32 are restricted. The conception in the 1980s that the private sector could substitute for the public sector in the provision of infrastructure has proven to be unfounded. The public sector has an indispensable role to play in financing projects in sectors where the private returns cannot capture the externalities generated by infrastructural projects. Foreign direct investment policies should be consistent with the country\u2019s develop- ment priorities and be an element of a broader strategy to raise productive investment and the development of skills and technology. An approach that seeks only to maximize the annual amount of foreign investment irrespective of the sector in which it is undertaken is implicitly a sectoral choice to base the country\u2019s development only on those sectors where it already has a good deal of comparative advantage. Successful late-industrializing countries have found the promotion of backward production linkages between foreign affiliates and domestic firms to be very important. State engagement helps to overcome what Lall (2000) calls information failures from inadequate knowledge, on the part of investors, of conditions of investment in developing countries. 6.2 Other capability enhancing and developing policies Lall (2000: 339) suggests that \u2018getting prices right\u2019 provides an insufficient incentive for firms to upgrade their technical capabilities in a globalized production context. Comparative advantage depends on a \u2018national ability to master and use technologies\u2019 rather than on \u2018factor endowments in the usual sense\u2019. In Lall\u2019s view, all exporting, including those of simple products, requires investments in capabilities such as procurement, production, engineer- ing, design, and marketing. The assistance of governments to firms to develop these capa- bilities and to assist in coordinating investments in \u2018vertically linked activities or undertake collective learning\u2019 (Lall 2000: 356) is critical. Transnational companies have advantages in these activities and can be encouraged to contribute to the national effort, but these cannot be counted on to sustain the effort in the long term or across product lines. Governments must either provide steady assistance to domestic firms or promote the entry of higher qual- ity FDI as domestic capabilities are upgraded. Moreover, assistance to small and medium enterprises and the development of flexible domestic capabilities will continue to be the responsibility of domestic authorities. A strategy of liberalization plus investment in general education, leaving to markets the identification of comparative advantage, could exploit existing advantages in simple produc- tion activities and would support growth in what Lall (2000) calls the \u2018easy stage manufactur- ing\u2019 stage. To advance beyond this stage would require costly learning and building specific skills, otherwise the country will not be able to participate in dynamic export growth, which 32 See Development Committee (2006). 41 is associated with a steadily changing structure of exports. The government has an important role in capability upgrading beyond general education. In recent years, the potential of services exports have been highlighted by the growth of information technology and business process outsourcing. Realistically, these growth sec- tors have benefited only a small number of countries. In the case of India, a long tradition of advanced engineering universities, originally motivated by its own import-substituting industrialization strategy, played a key role in the development of these services exports. In the case of business process outsourcing, a domestic capability in office procedures, specific skills in information technology, and accounting are often required. Developing countries seeking to develop these service exports have to undertake investment in these specific skills and realistically take into account the size of their populations to take advantage of scale economies and the lead time involved to create these capabilities. Historically, the most robust services exports have involved construction services and specialized services such as oil drilling and security services.

For the Republic of Korea, the learning-by-doing aspect of this activity was as important, if not more important than, the foreign exchange earnings. In order to undertake services exports of this type, domestic capabilities in organizing logistics internationally are necessary.33 The recent growth of medical tourism is also of interest. In this case, joint public-private efforts in producing specialized medical skills are required (as is also the case in industrial economies). If countries are installing the domestic capacity to achieve the health objectives of the MDGs (an exercise in industrial policy by itself) they can then consider expanding the volume of the health sector to enter into exporting medical services. In reality, the most significant service export earnings of countries derive from the remittances of its overseas workers. As a matter of human rights and to safeguard the timely receipt of these personal earnings, developing country governments have been called upon to facilitate remittances. While this is strictly beyond the scope of this paper, governments might consider motivating people who remit to invest their earnings in national development banks and through these augment the resources that can be used to fund industrial projects. Many overseas workers return with specific industrial skills and governments could consider whether it wants to assist the private sector in mechanisms to aggregate these skills in order to advance industrialization efforts. While it has never happened historically, could a country with many seafaring workers create an international shipping services industry? Noting that workers may seek employment abroad in services, a few other developing countries have in- vested in upgrading the skills of their workers, such as in operating certain types of machinery for example, so that they are able to obtain higher paying jobs abroad. This is an indirect way of increasing domestic capability to promote industrialization. 33 In reality, recent episodes of services liberalization by developing countries have resulted in the entry of banking, tourism, and logistics services into these countries. Unless these countries are already strong exporters of tangible products, the advantages of the entry of these services could mainly benefit the importing sector. In reality, the most significant service export earnings of countries derive from remittance earnings of its overseas workers. As a matter of human rights and to safeguard the timely receipt of these personal earnings, developing country governments have been called upon to facilitate remittances. See Development Committee (2006). 42 7. Role of international institutions in widening the policy space States undertake their trade and industrial policy in the context of international rules, their assistance engagements with donors, and their loans with international financial institu- tions. Each of these engagements imposes constraints on the kinds of policies that countries can undertake to pursue their development. The United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development, held in 2002 at Monterrey, Mexico, asserted that: Each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social develop- ment, and the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized.34 Each government needs to evaluate the trade-off between the advantages of accepting and complying with international rules and commitments and the limitations imposed by the loss of policy space. The considerations that the paper has posed above should inform this choice. Most critically, international rules and treaties are the outcomes of negotiations and treaties that countries create among themselves. It is important to realize that the nature of these commitments is shaped by perspectives about development policy and within that industrial policy. If, indeed, policy space is an essential ingredient to overcoming poverty, in- ternational institutions and regulations should first of all recognize that countries do indeed have the primary responsibility for their development and that these rules should provide the needed policy space that countries need to fulfil this responsibility. In March 2005, the signatories35 to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness com- mitted to the principle that national development strategies, which are constructed and designed by the recipient countries, will be the basis for donor assistance. If this principle is truly implemented, donors should provide assistance consistent with the development plans and strategies of the recipient countries. The real constraint lies in the capability of developing countries to undertake development planning that is consistent with their needs. If these principles are genuinely adhered to, it will require donors to alter their prac- tices, consider more effective approaches, such as expanding the use of budget support, as opposed to project support, since in theory the government budget is the expression of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5077c6c5-fdd6-4b84-bc18-74a150a8a182": {"__data__": {"id_": "5077c6c5-fdd6-4b84-bc18-74a150a8a182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6790016ccc8a9f4b1fbd444ac71a6cd55dc9548c6925c2f3780fde24619ea45"}}, "hash": "c6790016ccc8a9f4b1fbd444ac71a6cd55dc9548c6925c2f3780fde24619ea45", "text": "a country\u2019s current development programme. While this agenda has generated strong inter- est on the part of the donor community, which had initiated it, developing countries are not fully active in its development and conceptual discussions. At the present time, the \u2018aid ef- 34 United Nations (2003), p. 5. 35 Signatories included all the member countries of the OECD and some international financial institutions such as the World Bank. 43 fectiveness\u2019 effort is mainly driven by donors. It is important for developing countries, acting in the international sphere, with an understanding of what kind of policy space is required for their development, to begin to define the partnership between donors and recipients, starting with the definition of what should be counted as \u2018aid\u2019 to developing countries. The international community launched the Doha Round of trade negotiations in November 2001. The agreement to launch the round was based on two premises: to exhibit solidarity with United States, a proponent of the round, after the attacks on major buildings of September 2001; and to undertake a \u2018development round\u2019 in order to reform the rules and processes of the WTO to make them development-friendly. Developing countries now constitute the overwhelming majority of WTO Members. Their support for the Doha round was based on the view that the round would be an opportunity to improve the international trading system. Through the WTO and other international commitments, the international com- munity manages international trade, in the first place, through agreements on tariffs, sub- sidies, and product standards. While the average tariff of industrial countries are quite low compared to those in developing countries, their tariffs for products for which developing countries are most competitive, such as garments, are high. There should be a limitation of these so-called tariff peaks. The current proposal in the Doha Round being negotiated under the aegis of Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) applies a compression formula on the tariff rates of Member countries. This will affect the tariff peaks in developed coun- try tariffs, but depending on the parameters of the formula, it could also drastically reduce the level of all tariffs that developing countries can impose. Since most of the tariffs of developed countries are already at low levels, this will not cause their economies much harm. However, it could severely restrict the ability of developing countries to develop industries by preventing them from having high tariffs for industries promoted by them. There is acceptance of the principle that the parameters of the formula should be different between developed and developing countries, but there is continued disagreement over how different the levels should be. There are also controver- sies over whether certain sectors can be excluded from the application of the formula and the grounds on which these can be excluded. Countries that have succeeded in industrializing have utilized variable tariff levels through their development. For sectors where they are still uncompetitive, implementing low or zero tariff levels provide their domestic industries a competitive access to these products, especially if they are inputs to production. For those specific sectors where the country would like to build up a competitive capability, high tariffs have been applied while economies of scale have been exploited and learning-by-doing was taking place. Eventu- ally, when the sector was internationally competitive, tariffs protecting the sector have been reduced dramatically or eliminated. The progression from first protecting resource-using industries, to labour-intensive, to technology-intensive products has been used by many countries, but the actual pattern will depend on the resource endowments of the country and the capabilities of its labour force. This means that when the country is still developing its resource-using industries, for example, tariffs could be low or zero for labour-intensive 44 and advance technology products, but at a later stage the pattern could be reversed. In the context of this historical pattern, developing countries need an industrial development plan to determine their tariff negotiating strategies both at the multilateral and bilateral arenas. Without industrial policy, developing country negotiators will find themselves confined to protecting existing industries, where they already have some international competitiveness, instead of negotiating with a view to ensuring that future industrial sectors can be deve- loped. The danger that the proposed NAMA approach poses is that it will impose ceilings on tariff rates to all industrial products forever and prevent countries from implementing vari- able tariff rates appropriate to its level of development. The current negotiating proposals in the WTO exempt least developed countries for a fixed period. However, when this period is over, these countries would also be subject to the same restrictions for all time and prevent them", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4039cbe2-ab8f-4277-a7b3-ed2d317a65f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4039cbe2-ab8f-4277-a7b3-ed2d317a65f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ad1e88f8d8156dda2f534ebe38f1970bb7694b44556e4ebda354060d129640a"}}, "hash": "3ad1e88f8d8156dda2f534ebe38f1970bb7694b44556e4ebda354060d129640a", "text": "from applying variable tariffs for different stages of development. For the least developed countries, there has been progress toward providing them with duty-free and quota-free access to developed country markets. However, a limitation was introduced in the December 2005 WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong (SAR, China), which exempted three percent of the goods being imported by rich countries. Since least developed countries have a narrow industrial base, the three percent exception could con- stitute all the products they could possibly export to rich country markets. Beyond tariffs and trade-related commitments, the WTO and other trade treaties have begun to include limitations on country policies, as noted earlier. The TRIMs Agree- ment severely reduces the ability of countries to impose performance requirements, such as domestic value-added, on foreign investors. While these restrictions are certainly to the advantage of multinational companies, the overwhelming majority of which come from de- veloped countries, they are also justified as \u2018being good\u2019 for developing countries, because they are thought to improve the investment climate by imposing reduced conditionalities on foreign investors. In actual practice, international investment flows have been highly concentrated in a few developing countries. The countries that have seen strong invest- ment interest are not necessarily those that have imposed the least restrictions. In view of the range of policies that would be required for development, it would be important for countries to seek to redefine which restrictions should be the subject of international agree- ments and which should be the province of national authorities. Additional restrictions on investors due to environmental issues have been the most controversial. However, States have many other social and economic pressures, to deal with which their ability to regulate investment is important. Developing country governments have expanded the creation of caucuses and groupings in line with the Doha development round negotiations, taking stances that are consistent with the interest that trade rules do not inhibit capital accumulation and the building up of international competitiveness. This effort is necessary if the outcome of the Doha negotiations is truly developmental. 45 It is useful here to summarize the key points of this paper. Industrial policy is the applica- tion of selective government interventions to favour certain sectors so that their expansion benefits the productivity of the economy as a whole. The authors have made the point that because of the frequency of increasing returns to scale, information externalities, and other market imperfections, States are called upon to regulate and intervene in private markets. In the case of developing countries, markets particularly cannot be relied upon in ensuring the capability upgrading that is required to overcome poverty. They also emphasized that because the economies of developing coun- tries are now more directly attached to the international economy as compared to the past, it becomes even more critical for social interventions toward specific increases in capability in specific areas. Otherwise, the economy will remain uncompetitive and condemned to underdevelopment. States are \u2018doomed to choose\u2019 to undertake \u2018industrial policy\u2019, whether consciously or otherwise. The more dependent countries are on exports and the interna- tional economy, the more unavoidable is industrial policy because of specific features in technology when undertaking effort in capability building. In the last few decades, when it became the fashion for States to stop providing protection for their domestic enterprises, the array of policies encouraging and providing implicit or explicit subsidies for foreign investment constituted a specific configuration of industrial policy. The argument is, therefore, that States in developing countries would be better off having a deliberate and explicit industrial policy, consistent with their natural endowments, their stage of development, and their political arrangements. Industrial policy involves the configuration and management of relations between the State, on the one hand, and inves- tors, capitalists, and firms, on the other. At the risk of slighting the built-in technological and capabilities dimensions, one shorthand way of describing \u2018industrial policy\u2019 is that it is the State policy toward \u2018industrialists\u2019. Industrial policy is effective if the outcome of this relation- ship is in the interest of the whole nation. When development is redefined as the reduction of poverty, effective industrial policy occurs when the ongoing relationship of firms and production units to the State results in risk-taking, technical upgrading, investment, and growth that reduces poverty. The paper then explored the required capacities that States need for industrial policy, addressing the observations that governments do not have the knowledge and tools to intervene and that the international rules severely constrict the space of governments to do 8.

Toward the end of the paper we discussed the current chal- lenges, both domestic and external, that need to be overcome in undertaking industrial policy. We discussed the role of policy space and the kind of reforms in the international arena that are needed to permit countries to be truly responsible for their own develop- ment. Thus, developing countries should consider the following approaches in regard to industrial policy: \uf06c Development policy making should include a realistic assessment of the industrial capabilities of a country. This assessment should include an assessment of techno- logical capabilities in different industries. There should also be a shift in the discourse on competitiveness, focusing toward productivity and away from the aspect of wage competitiveness. \uf06c Governments should upgrade their capabilities in dealing with the private sector and industry associations in terms of understanding technical issues and market structures to better evaluate requests and resist pressures for subsidy and protection. Some of these capabilities do not have to reside within the staff; governments can rely on domestic and foreign consultants on an ad hoc basis. \uf06c Taking into account the need to upgrade governance capabilities, Governments would benefit strongly from explicit approaches and plans for industrial develop- ment. \uf06c States should expand the alignment between their educational and technological development strategies with their industrial development strategies. \uf06c Trade policies, including the stances toward trade negotiations, should be consistent with the national industrial development strategies. Developing countries should limit the loss of policy space from international commitments and treaties. 47 Aguayo Ayala, F. and Kevin P.

The average yearly wage ( ) is calculated by dividing the total yearly payments ( ) to workers by the total number of employees ( ) for each industry group in each country. The calculations can be expressed as follows: The average yearly wage for country i at time t is . Then, mean deviation of wage ( ) for country i at time t is the percentage differ- ence of the average yearly wage from the weighted average wage for all the countries at time t ( ), and is calculated as: . The weighted average wage for all countries is calculated as: , where the share of the number of employees for each industry in total manufacturing is used as the weights. Next, using Ward\u2019s (1963) method, we applied the clustering procedure. Ward\u2019s method performs clustering by seeking at each step the minimum ratio within clusters to the total variance in whole differences set and the existing cluster means.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddf0b02e-144e-4575-b6c6-8f6bc07224dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddf0b02e-144e-4575-b6c6-8f6bc07224dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Who's Afraid of Industrial Policy?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3749046940bc4e3d95731c9845d4f471587880d0a3ce216ef0eb0a028216be5a"}, "2": {"node_id": "0eb25320-5486-48cf-9287-856e6a187f02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whos-afraid-industrial-policy", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80762a564790894407c87b1e768c52dfbe839fdfe886794b2e795eff41965f08"}}, "hash": "d24bafe80da830587ff0775753109dab39bcd0cb54552c9048488d48b9b2b9ea", "text": "Ward\u2019s method is a hierarchical type of agglomerative nesting method, which follows iterative steps.

As nations are strengthening their efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), energy as a critical input for development has yet to be adequately and appropriately addressed. It is a well-established fact that access to reliable and affordable energy services helps improve efficiency and productivity, enhances living standards and overall livelihoods through quantitative and qualitative impacts on health, literacy and education. Therefore, priority measures need to be enacted for its affordable access to all nations, and communities within the nations. Recognizing the critical need to support countries in extending the access of modern energy services in a cost-effective manner to the poor, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), through its Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) in Asia- Pacific, commissioned national-level rapid gap assessments in 15 countries in Asia and 15 countries in the Pacific. The primary aims of these assessments were to identify gaps in drivers that link energy access to poverty reduction, and to identify priority needs to enhance access to affordable modern energy services. The framework for the assessments was developed through two sub-regional consultation meetings held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005) and Apia, Samoa (September 2005). In finalizing the framework for the country-level assessments, gender concerns and its linkages to energy poverty were identified as crucial factors that needed special attention. As a result, two sub-regional assessments on energy and gender \u2013 one for the Asian region and the other for the Pacific region \u2013 were commissioned. However, as the messages in the two assessments complemented one another, they were combined into this single Asia-Pacific regional report, Will Tomorrow be Brighter than Today? Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region. This Report critically iii Countries in the Asia-Pacific region need to pay adequate attention to energy services if they are to meet the MDGs analyses the gender-related issues affecting the promotion of energy access and proposes pragmatic recommendations on mainstreaming gender concerns in strengthening energy access. Specifically, the Report attempts to establish links between energy access, gender equity and poverty reduction; identifies critical gaps in access to energy services; and recommends options for mainstreaming gender into energy access policy strategies and programming. It is hoped that this work will be of relevance to national policy makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organiza- tions and other interested persons, including academia, to preparing and implementing gender-sensitive energy services policies and projects to promote access to modern energy services for the poor and the unserved. iv This report is an outcome of the partnership initiatives of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Asia-Pacific Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR). It benefits from a year and a half of collaboration between the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB), UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (RCC), UNDP Country Offices in the Asia-Pacific region and key national, as well as regional, experts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9f626c5-59ae-4dda-baa5-f23e23b69936": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9f626c5-59ae-4dda-baa5-f23e23b69936", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5b924910ab16ad248b7dc0a7fa4e896ecb533715682c1fff2f3ae1eeee25986"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5b149f0-b39e-4bd1-b250-8fd0ead3ab2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbb6534dc69e0d7bd3b8f10dd1fb6f4457b18d10ae054094a38de84f3cb2a2de"}}, "hash": "151c61f873c150a5f0335057fec5e867e6354f1bb8acae91e084a7ed287abae8", "text": "We would like to record our appreciation for the inputs, suggestions and support provided by various energy, environment and gender focal points of the UNDP Asia-Pacific Country Offices, in particular: Arif Alauddin, Shakil Ahmed, Hudha Ahmed, Darshani Desilva, Faiza Effendi, Massoom Farhad,Tek B.Gurung,Easter Galuvao,Eeva Harma,Le Van Hung, Katihanna Ilomaki, Mehdi Kamyab, Asfaazam Kasbani, Imee Manal, Emma Mario,Gwen Maru,Filipe Mesquita,Koos Neefjes,Sirixai Phanthavongs,He Ping, Asenaca Ravuvu, Shireen K Sayeed, Aminath Shooza, and Tungalag Ulambayar.

In 2000,an estimated 1.1 billion people subsisted on incomes below US$1 a day,across the world. More than 60 percent of these people lived in the Asia-Pacific region. In most countries of the region, the number of poor women is higher than that of poor men. In addition, women\u2019s participation in the workforce in South and South-east Asia is largely restricted to the informal economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for women in the region is extremely low and is often less than half and sometimes only one-third of the GDP for men. Executive summary Energy services are linked to well-being and have the potential to impact on almost every area of human life xii Executive summary Rural electrification In all the Asia-Pacific countries (and in developing countries in general), rural electrification continues to be the largest rural energy programme, both in terms of investment as well as coverage.The main issues in rural electrification are: the limited expansion of the grid in most countries, especially to remote areas;erratic and unreliable power supply,leading to dependence on multiple fuels for lighting; and high price (in most countries), makeing electricity unaffordable for the very poor. Furthermore, the unsuitability of electricity to address cooking energy needs in most countries and the continued reliance on biomass fuels mean that energy programmes seldom impact women\u2019s lives in any significant way. Most of the benefits from rural electrification go to wealthier people. Once connected, the amount of electricity consumed and therefore the benefits obtained depend on the ability to purchase electrical equipment, light fixtures, televisions, fans, water heaters, water pumps or motor-driven machines. Thus, the poor \u2013 particularly poor women \u2013 are often excluded from the benefits of electricity. There is an implicit assumption that the benefits of electricity are gender neutral; however, this is a misplaced notion as women perceive the need for and use of electricity quite differently from men. Decisions regarding the use of electricity are often taken by men, which means that women may or may not benefit from the provisioning of electricity. The role of the public sector in electricity provisioning is likely to diminish in the future, except as a regulator and facilitator. Liberalization of the petroleum markets in most countries of the region has meant that governments exercise less control over pricing, provisioning of services and supplies in the petroleum sector. These developments pose a challenge for energy provisioning in Asia and the Pacific; whether they will lead to greater efficiency and increased access for the poor, especially for poor women, is not yet clear. Smoky kitchens and other health concerns More than half the population in developing countries still relies on traditional biomass fuels for cooking and heating and are subject to all The poor \u2013 particularly poor women \u2013 are often excluded from the benefits of electricity xiii Executive summary the health risks posed by their combustion. Women are exposed to a variety of health hazards from cooking over poorly ventilated indoor fires, including respiratory infections,cancers and eye diseases.Globally,indoor air pollution accounts for 1.6 million premature deaths per year (WHO 2005). Exposure to indoor air pollutants enhances the risk of lower respiratory infections in children and pulmonary disease in women. In addition, increasing deforestation means that women now have to traverse longer distances for fuel wood and water, leading to postural defects and other health risks. In most countries covered by this study, the primary biomass fuel used is wood, with the exception of Bangladesh, where agricultural residues are the predominant fuel. Countries like Cambodia, Lao PDR and Sri Lanka rely almost entirely on wood as a source of biomass. Relatively simple, inexpensive stoves can reduce the fuel needed for cooking by as much as 30 percent and ease pressure on land and conserve scarce income. Other benefits to women are the time saved in fuel wood collection and cooking, a reduction in the drudgery of household chores, and a decline in indoor air pollution, which leads to better health for women and children. In the foreseeable future, the probability of eliminating this dependence on traditional energy sources (especially fuel wood) in rural areas is low.In a few areas, the supply of conventional commercial energy and/or decentralized alternatives like biogas, solar power and other non- conventional energies (for lighting) may emerge,but these are unlikely to replace the dependence on traditional fuels. As a result, biomass will continue to be the fuel of \u2018first choice\u2019in most of Asia and the Pacific.

In most Asia-Pacific countries, women\u2019s energy needs have been addressed primarily through special programmes like the introduction of more efficient and less smoky stoves, biogas plants and solar cookers. Renewable energy technologies (RETs) like biogas and improved cook stoves (ICS), both of which have demonstrated gender benefits that are well documented, have failed to make a significant impact in country programmes (barring exceptions like China).Even in the PICs,where there is substantial potential for the development of renewable energy sources, the share of renewable energy in total energy supply remains small. Credit and microfinance to meet energy needs The availability of credit and finance is critical for enabling women\u2019s participation in using improved energy supplies. The promotion of energies/systems for income-generating purposes and the adaptation of a credit scheme to reduce down-payment requirements and extend the payment periods could expand the market for these systems, bringing down costs and making them more accessible to women and less- affluent borrowers. Gender concerns missing in energy policy and planning, constraints to women\u2019s enterprise The absence of gender-sensitive project planning, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) emerged as a common issue in all the Gap Assessment Country Reports.1 Energy policies require gender mainstreaming, a recognition of the impact of energy on women and an articulation of the issues that affect women. In response to this understanding, appropriate policies and interventions need to be designed. Within the Asia-Pacific region, women operate a large number of micro and small-scale enterprises, particularly in the informal sector.These enterprises tend to be concentrated around a narrow range of activities such as food-processing industries and service-sector activities, with relatively low rates of return as compared to men\u2019s activities. Women\u2019s The availability of credit and finance is critical to enabling women\u2019s participation in using improved energy supplies 1 The Gap Assessment Country Reports were commissioned by the UNDP's Regional Energy Programme for the Asia and Pacific.The reports were conducted in 15 Asian countries and a regional assessment of 15 Pacific Island Countries. xv Executive summary enterprises are also adversely affected by the social and practical constraints related to ownership and control over productive resources.The ability of poor women to generate livelihoods is also constrained by high marketing costs. In addition, the informal nature of these industries makes it difficult for women to access credit, equipment, market information, technical training and other support services. Conclusions There is a need to extend energy provisioning across most of Asia and the Pacific, both in electricity and in cooking fuels, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene and RETs. The high complementarities between energy and development, energy and gender equity, and the impact energy has on other basic services like water and sanitation,make energy pivotal to poverty eradication strategies and measures directed at achieving the MDGs. \u2022 If the current situation continues,the number of people without access to electricity in 2030 will be around 1.4 billion (only 200 million less than at present), and the number of people who rely on traditional biomass for cooking fuel needs will be 2.6 billion (more than at present). \u2022 The lack of disaggregated data regarding energy use,supply and impact by gender is a major hindrance for applying methods and tools for incorporating a gender perspective in project design and implementation. \u2022 The provision of energy and whether or not women are able to take advantage of it in terms of greater incomes, increased leisure, reduced drudgery and/or access to education depends on a number of factors, including social and cultural attitudes. \u2022 Inherent inequities,such as between urban/rural areas,rich/poor people and men/women,need to be recognized in strategy planning and design.

Policy advocacy is also necessary at the regional and country level to encourage the establishment of women\u2019s enterprises 2 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? It is simply unacceptable that such widespread energy deprivation, with its consequences for nutrition, health, education, welfare and environment, should continue into the next millennium. \u2013 WEC/FAO, The Challenge of Rural Energy Poverty in Developing Countries, 1999 Energy is often viewed as the pivot of growth, the availability of which is an essential element of any strategy of change and advancement.Energy security3 is a goal that nation states aspire to because energy is an enabler and has the potential to bring change. Although energy is not explicitly listed as a Millennium Development Goal (MDG),it is now recognized that the provision of energy services is critical to development \u2013 and for achieving the MDGs. Access to modern sources of energy (including electricity) helps in expanding choices for individuals and assists them in capability expansion. Modern energy services are an essential element of developing the enabling conditions that can allow a country to meet the MDGs (Modi 2005).Energy is no doubt an enabler \u2013 an enabler not only of growth, but of opportunity as well. With the benefit of development experience, it is possible to unequivocally state that energy is essential not only for growth, but for the attainment of the key goals that have been set: the eradication of poverty and inequity, and the provision of opportunity in equal measure to all. Energy need not however be seen only as an input to production and an ingredient for growth. Equitable, diversified and enlarged access to energy can in fact improve productivity and income at all levels, reduce inequities and substantially change the way people live, particularly the poor and the disadvantaged. It is for this reason that attention needs to be focused on minimum service provisioning and on issues of access, quality and supply. 2 Gender refers to the socially", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "863fde61-fffb-466e-82a9-7ece097452eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "863fde61-fffb-466e-82a9-7ece097452eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78505a17850c0b43a190e215ef420594c360f89083fc675547b71adcc6d3e889"}}, "hash": "78505a17850c0b43a190e215ef420594c360f89083fc675547b71adcc6d3e889", "text": "constructed roles rather than biologically determined roles of men and women as well as the relationships between men and women in society at a specific time and place (UNDP 2004c).

Security of energy supply has economic, social and political dimensions, and the social and political dimensions are more difficult to capture. Gender, 2 energy and poverty The provision of energy services is critical to development \u2013 and for achieving the MDGs 3 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Access to electricity, the most common form in which energy is increasingly available, is particularly skewed. Rich countries consume more energy than poor countries (UNDP 2005a). Poor people inevitably make do with less energy services, or even none, and are faced with problems of poor quality, irregular supply and high price. Within the broad grouping of the poor, the disadvantaged and the marginalized make do with even less (Clancy et al. 2003). It is important also to view poverty not just within the narrow prism of income. Viewed in the context of deprivation, energy can be a liberator and a catalyst, a means of empowerment, providing opportunity, security and an instrument to confront inequity. Energy has the potential to change the lives of men and women in irreversible ways.The provision of energy services can help people living in poverty to remedy at least two of the pervasive problems that keep them in poverty \u2013 their low productivity and their limited range of productive options. 1.1 Poverty and energy: energy has the power In 2000, an estimated 1.1 billion people globally subsisted on incomes below US$1 a day.More than 60 percent of these people lived in the Asia- Pacific region: 432 million (39.2 percent) in South Asia and 261 million (23.4 percent) in East Asia and the Pacific (UNDP 2004b). In most countries of the region,the number of poor women is higher than that of poor men (IFAD 2002). This is not un-representative of the world; some estimates put the proportion of women at as much as 70 percent of the world\u2019s poor. Women-headed households in rural areas form a significant proportion of the poor (UNDP 2004a). Furthermore, women in poverty are more challenged than men.They find it more difficult to break away since they have less access to resources than men and suffer from severe social deprivation (IFAD 2002). Access to affordable energy services is an essential prerequisite to achieving economic growth and poverty reduction. Approximately 1.6 billion people in the world do not have electricity. About 2.4 billion rely on traditional fuels, such as wood, charcoal, dung, and agricultural residues, for cooking and heating (Saghir 2006). Grid-based electrical power does not reach many rural and poor urban areas in developing countries, nor is there adequate distribution of gas or other cooking and heating fuels. Women in poverty are more challenged than men \u2013 they find it more difficult to break away since they have less access to resources Energy also has an equity dimension: poor households use less energy than wealthier ones in absolute terms and spend a higher proportion of their income on energy than higher-income households. For example, in Hyderabad (India), poor households spend 10 to 15 percent of their income on energy,while wealthy households spend less than five percent (ESMAP 1999, quoted in Saghir 2006). Poor people in rural areas spend a smaller share of their income on energy, but it is still a significant proportion. In rural India, poor households spend as much as eight percent of their incomes on energy for lighting, most of it on kerosene (ESMAP 2000). Energy services also cost the poor more because using fuels such as wood and kerosene for cooking and lighting is less efficient than using modern fuels. In addition, the poor usually buy fuel wood and charcoal in small amounts. When the transaction costs are taken into account,energy for cooking often ends up being more expensive for poor people than for the better-off (Saghir 2006). Unlike the rich, poor people find it hard to make even the smallest investments and may therefore end up using less-efficient equipment and/or fuel,often leading to high costs for the households,both in terms of time and money (Clancy et al. 2003).

In most countries in the region, biomass collection, fuel wood collection and the drying of agro-residues are all tasks that are inevitably left to women. Given the primary responsibility of women for household energy procurement and management (and the invisibility of these tasks in national energy accounts),energy poverty4 acquires a specific and strong gender dimension. The time and physical effort expended by women and girls in gathering fuel and carrying water seriously limits their ability to engage in educational and income-generating activities. Literacy rates and school enrolment levels, for example, are substantially different for men and women (UNDP 2004a). Since the burden of household chores and responsibilities is unequally shared, women have limited \u2013 if any \u2013 prospects of carving out time and resources for themselves. In addition, the use of biomass has a number of adverse repercussions, on health, on livelihoods and on the time available for women to engage in other activities. Thus, any improvement in the access to energy would have a dramatic impact on the lives of women and girl children. 4 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? 4 Energy poverty means the absence of sufficient choice in accessing adequate affordable, reliable, clean, high-quality, safe and benign energy services to support economic and human development \u2013 World Energy Assessment, 2000. Energy services also cost the poor more because using fuels such as wood and kerosene for cooking and lighting is less efficient than using modern fuels Energy services are linked to well-being and have the potential to impact on almost every area of human activity,from increased economic activity, to improved child literacy and safer drinking water. Research suggests that while increased access to more convenient energy supplies may not be a sufficient condition for development, it may well be a necessary condition. At the micro level,it is empirically difficult to measure the impact of small investments in energy services on poverty and to establish causal links; however, there are strong reasons to advocate that energy interventions do indeed produce positive benefits.This impact is likely to vary with the presence of complementary inputs. For instance, the bundling of services like water sanitation and education with electricity has disproportionately larger benefits; the whole is substantially larger than the sum of the parts (IDS 2003). An experience from outside the region that has demonstrated significant gains is the Multi-Functional Platform in Mali. The platform, which is a simple diesel engine that can power different tools, has reduced workloads, increased productivity and income earnings, and has impacted positively on women and girls\u2019 educational performance as well (see Box 1).The Mali example shows that a simple intervention has the potential to deliver multiple benefits and illustrates the linkages between gender, energy and poverty. 5 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Box 1: Multi-Functional Platform: multiple gains from a single intervention Sources: Burn and Coche (2001) and UNDP (2004a) Energy services are linked to well-being and have the potential to impact on almost every area of human activity The Multi-Functional Platform facility was first started in the 1990s in Mali. Today, more than 400 such platforms are operational in more than 70 villages across Mali, and the programme has been extended to Burkina Faso, Senegal, Guinea and Cote d\u2019Ivoire. The platform consists of a diesel engine to which a variety of end-use equipment can be attached, such as grain mills,battery chargers,oil presses, welding machines and carpentry tools. Its advantage is its simplicity, sturdiness and multiple uses. The platform has freed up about six hours of time every day for women and has meant an increase of at least 50 percent in their income. A considerable amount of time that was earlier expended in the crushing of shea nuts to produce butter is now saved. The production of shea butter has tripled, as has the annual income. Domestic chores such as cereal grinding and water carrying have also been simplified, and the benefits include expanded economic opportunities, better education (since more time can be devoted to studies) and empowerment. This simple intervention has meant the provision of affordable energy services, the creation of income-generating activities, and increased free time for the women. 1.2 The importance of a gendered approach Energy poverty has much in common with other forms of the poverty.

A recent study by UNICEF says that inequality at home (between men and women) leads to poorer health for the children and greater poverty for the family. Equality between men and women is therefore essential for lowering poverty and improving health, especially the health of children, in developing countries. The study shows that where women are excluded from family decisions, children are more likely to be under-nourished. Where men control the household, less money is spent on health care and food for the family, resulting in poorer health for the children.The same study points out that increasing employment and income-earning opportunities for women would increase women\u2019s household power.For example,it was found that whoever has the greater share of household income and assets decides whether those resources will be used to meet family needs.There would be 13 million fewer malnourished children in South Asia if women had an equal say in the family (UNICEF 2006). According to the study, women\u2019s involvement in government tends to result in policies that are focused on children and families. However, women are under-represented in legislatures around the world, due to lower levels of education, social attitudes and their greater work burden. Thus when the income earning capacities of women are augmented through energy provisioning and services, the benefits accrue to the family as a whole and to children in particular.These gains are manifested in better education, improved nourishment and better health care. While increased income in the hands of women leads to better care of the family as a whole and for women themselves, there is another important reason for emphasizing a gendered approach to energy provisioning and services. This is \u201cthe need to challenge and dismantle the structures of men\u2019s power and privilege, and end the cultural and social permission for acts of violence that is often prevalent in patriarchal societies\u201d. In this context it is argued that it is essential to involve men to work in 6 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? Equality between men and women is therefore essential for lowering poverty and improving health in developing countries cooperation with women to reshape the gender organization of society, in particular, the institutions and relations through which we raise children. This requires more emphasis on the importance of men as nurturers and caregivers, involved in the raising of children in positive ways, free of violence (Kaufman 1998). A gendered approach to the issue of energy poverty thus needs to take into account the changing roles of both men and women, and energy policies need to be designed such that they enable both men and women to lead better lives. It is therefore important to analyse the gender and poverty links as well as the gender and energy linkages. At a more practical level, it is becoming increasingly clear that the ways by which men and women become poor are different, as are their capacities to extricate themselves from poverty. Ending women\u2019s drudgery in the context of access to energy is more than simply reallocating economic resources; it involves redistributing power.Men will have to relinquish some of their economic, political and social power if women are to have their fair share of it (UNDP 2006). Some areas where these differences are clearly visible are detailed below: \u2022 Men and women are positioned differently in relation to the \u2018productive\u2019 and \u2018reproductive\u2019 economies; this affects their assets and entitlements. A number of studies show that men and women view energy differently.Technology is rarely gender neutral and men and women have different relationships with it due to the sexual division of labour. The issue of access and control of technologies within households and communities is an important one and needs to be addressed specifically (Cecelski 2002). \u2022 Conventionally, poverty has been measured by examining the income and basic needs dimensions. A more complete analysis should take into account how men and women experience poverty differently. To do this, a more extensive definition of poverty is required \u2013 one that includes social autonomy, power and agency as dimensions of poverty. \u2022 Inheritance laws in many developing countries hinder asset accumulation for women. Even if women do inherit property, it is often the male members of the family who manage it, with men making decisions for the women. 7 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Energy policies need to be designed such that they enable both men and women to lead better lives \u2022 Women have", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "946a17de-8eec-417a-b525-daf1cea6dcc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "946a17de-8eec-417a-b525-daf1cea6dcc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6da0eb769ceca4266d625d05ddf2e1deaa6c8febf7232796ead464d77c082230"}, "3": {"node_id": "46dc40b3-bc89-475d-a671-21d2170f9de4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4c760867a52d62f74da947e1363d2059e4533c9680cca0e8aac5b7c8adf1022"}}, "hash": "85911105b1b22b49ae4cec092da2bf3a0b865f5c63481be4cd8d39a51db37916", "text": "specific needs for electricity in the pumping of water, agricultural processing, security, work productivity and health. Energy policies need to recognize these needs as well as other time and labour needs of women so that they can engage in income- generating activities.Women benefit more from certain community- based initiatives such as street lighting (improves security) and water purification (improves health) (Cecelski 2000). \u2022 Poor women and girls spend a disproportionate amount of their time on unpaid household labour and farming tasks.This time is not accounted for in the national income statistics nor in calculations relating to energy needs and expenditures. This unpaid labour is often seen as \u2018free\u2019,but it is neither free nor cheap.It reduces the time that women have available for education or for income-generating activities. \u2022 Women are good \u2018traditional energy managers\u2019at the household level; poorer women have to manage with extremely frugal resources.It is now being recognized that women can play a vital role in popularizing new technologies that are non-polluting and sustainable. However, women have been excluded from energy policy debates and decision making, even though they are key stakeholders in the development process. 1.3 Gender and energy: recharging women\u2019s lives Energy is needed for cooking, heating, lighting, for agricultural tasks like tilling, irrigation, harvesting, milling and processing, and for industrial activities.It is also required as an input for water supply,communications, health, education and transportation. The energy needs of women, however, are quite different from those of men. In rural areas, for example, men use energy predominantly for agriculture, transportation and industries, while women need energy inputs for their household chores such as cooking, space heating, post-harvest processing and for small enterprises. In the absence of modern energy services, women spend a large amount of their time on unpaid household and farm tasks, leaving little time for much else. Addressing women\u2019s basic subsistence needs and releasing their time and labour through improved energy services is a necessary first step 8 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? In the absence of modern energy services, women spend a large amount of their time on unpaid household and farm tasks towards poverty reduction. The role for energy services then is one of reducing drudgery, freeing time from domestic chores to provide flexibility to the working day of women,and enabling them to participate in productive activities. The availability of electricity can extend the working day, assist in the establishment of small home industries and improve productivity in agriculture (Clancy et al. 2003). When energy has to be purchased, men enter the decision-making process, and often, energy is purchased first for recreational equipment (Televisions and radios) and then for labour-saving equipment which can simplify domestic tasks (Clancy et al. 2003). Decisions on how/where electricity and electricity services are provided to households and communities also influence women\u2019s ability to take advantage of these services. For example, an evaluation of a rural electrification project in Tamil Nadu,India showed that men benefited more than women because the electricity provided was used to run irrigation pumps, which substituted for oxen-drawn water (Rengaswamy et al. 2001). This was a task performed by men; once simplified, the men gained free time and could engage in politics and in improving agricultural methods.The men thus bettered their social and human capital, while the needs of the women were not addressed at all. If energy is provisioned for women, they too can experience similar gains in social and human capital. Energy can provide valuable benefits to women such as time savings and reduced household expenditure, increased school attendance by girls, and empowerment through having more choice in organizing their work and through access to television and media. Better energy access can also directly help women\u2019s income-earning activities. Women\u2019s micro-enterprises, which make an important contribution to the household income and in women\u2019s empowerment, are often heat-intensive (food processing); labour-intensive; and/or light- intensive (home-based industries with work in evenings).The absence of quality energy and other coordinated support for these activities (such as information and technical training, access to equipment, credit facilities and markets) affects women\u2019s ability to operate micro-enterprises profitably and safely (Cecelski 2000).Thus,the provision of affordable and regular energy supply is a key factor in the sustainability of these enterprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46dc40b3-bc89-475d-a671-21d2170f9de4": {"__data__": {"id_": "46dc40b3-bc89-475d-a671-21d2170f9de4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6da0eb769ceca4266d625d05ddf2e1deaa6c8febf7232796ead464d77c082230"}, "2": {"node_id": "946a17de-8eec-417a-b525-daf1cea6dcc3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85911105b1b22b49ae4cec092da2bf3a0b865f5c63481be4cd8d39a51db37916"}}, "hash": "d4c760867a52d62f74da947e1363d2059e4533c9680cca0e8aac5b7c8adf1022", "text": "While energy may have important effects on women in relation to the MDGs (see Table 1), this varies greatly according to the social and economic environment in which the women are placed. 9 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Energy can provide valuable benefits to women such as time savings and reduced household", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "708879ef-e6ee-4034-a8a3-bd1b424526fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "708879ef-e6ee-4034-a8a3-bd1b424526fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a71dc770545406435004ae81b4394e062afeb92cb0c6bccf0ee9ab85299b569"}, "3": {"node_id": "abf6f740-d056-4c97-ba97-5e21fb4b6c60", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b76d61c6ab2d2c94d4cc767061a806909ba30475ae641aba5cc721a577c76c3"}}, "hash": "9526e735d920be1d60a41b60b6c3468d28bd860b438a0f8473d9741d5165f9a2", "text": "expenditure Furthermore, savings in energy costs and improvements in energy efficiency can effectively increase household income and food consumption. For example, some studies estimate a reduction in household expenditures on energy of between 20 to 50 percent with more efficient and lower-cost cook stoves and lighting fuels.However,the amount of income generated from improved fuels and lighting and how much control women have in decisions on the use of such increased income is unclear. Ultimately, energy impacts maternal health and leads to reduced infant mortality and improved infant and child health, as well as contributing to a decline in deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions (ENERGIA December 2005).Thus, energy impacts a range of MDGs, such as the goal to achieve universal primary education, promote gender equity and the empowerment of women, reduce child mortality and improve maternal health, and ensure environmental sustainability (MDGs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7). 10 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Will tomorrow be brighter than today?

The programme facilitates women borrowers of Grameen Bank to access GSM mobile technology through the Village Phones (VP). The VP serves as an owner-operated pay phone and the \u2018telephone ladies\u2019become mobile public call offices.This allows the rural poor who cannot afford to become regular subscribers to avail of telecommunication services. A loan from the Grameen Bank (usually about Taka 12,000) pays for a handset,the subscription and incidental expenses. The regular supply of electricity is a prerequisite for the success of Grameen Phones, since the phones require frequent recharging. Initiated in 1997, the VP Programme has grown rapidly, and in May 2006, there were more than 200,000 VP subscribers.The VPs in operation now provide telecommunications access to more than 60 million people living in rural areas of Bangladesh. In a country with the lowest phone density in South Asia, the Grameen Phone operators provide villagers with vital links to services such as hospitals, to relatives both at home and abroad, and to markets in the cities. The Village Phone programme provides broad benefits, including higher productivity, greater social welfare, new sources of rural income, and enhances the social status of women from poor rural households.

Energy can reduce drudgery of tasks such as agro-processing, grinding and milling, and increase opportunity for enterprise and income generation. Using energy services for income generation a) Modern energy sources can impact on women\u2019s agricultural tasks and productivity: Women are responsible for the high-drudgery, low-technical input tasks like weeding and planting in agriculture, which can be made easier through energy inputs. Mechanized agro-processing can increase food supply, with reduced effort. Biogas slurry can help improve agricultural productivity. b) Modern energy services can impact on income generation in non- agricultural activities: Women operate many informal sector enterprises, and these can benefit from improved energy services. More efficient fuel conversion technologies can reduce energy costs in industries.

When freed from chores like fuel wood collection, girls (and boys, as the case may be), can attend school. Street lighting improves safety at night, especially for women. As modern lifestyles become more rushed, women need more cooking and energy options to aid their work. Availability of efficient equipment for cooking, heating, water supply and lighting. Availability of electricity allows women and girls safe movement in conflict/emergency situations. 5 Empowerment is about power and changing power relations in favour of those who previously exercised little power over their own lives. Batliwala (1993) defines power as having two central aspects \u2013 control over resources (physical, human, intellectual, financial and the self), and control over ideology (beliefs, values and attitudes). Table 1: Impact of energy on MDG 1 (continued) Different forms of energy can meet women\u2019s strategic needs and help to provide them with some control over their own time and lives Source: Dutta (2005) control over their own time and lives, and this in turn may contribute to women\u2019s empowerment. Empowerment implies women have more autonomy and are better able to make decisions on issues that shape their lives, both at the household level and in society in general. This autonomy can be financial if women as individuals have means of making money and can spend it as they choose. But it can also mean more freedom. Empowerment of women might mean, for example, that educational and career opportunities are open to them, where these were formerly restricted. 13 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Table 2: Improving the position of women through energy: some possibilities Energy Form6 Women\u2019s needs Practical Productive Strategic Electricity Pumping water: reducing need to haul and carry Mills for grinding Lighting improves working conditions at home Increase possibility of activities during evening hours Provide refrigeration for food production and sale Power for specialized enterprises such as hairdressing and internet cafes Make streets safer: allowing participation in other activities (e.g. evening classes and women\u2019s group meetings) Expand horizons through radio,TV and internet Improved biomass (supply and conversion technology) Improved health through better stoves Less time and effort in gathering and carrying firewood More time for productive activities Lower cost of process heat for income-generating activities Control of natural forests in community forestry management frameworks Mechanical Milling and grinding Transporting water and crops Increases variety of enterprises Transport: allowing access to commercial and social/political opportunities 6 Practical needs are for household tasks;productive needs are for enterprises;strategic needs are for women\u2019s empowerment. Empowerment implies women have more autonomy and are better able to make decisions on issues that shape their lives Source: Clancy et al.(2003) Energy is one of the many elements that contribute to the empowerment of women.It is not energy that has the potential to empower women,but the process by which the energy technology is introduced itself that often empowers women. Empowerment may also come as a result of having the technology (Clancy and Dutta 2005). There are a number of examples of women taking up energy technologies that have contributed to increasing their incomes. Enterprises that manufacture or sell energy equipment (such as cook stoves),produce energy for sale (as in the Multi-Functional Platforms of Mali described in Box 1),and provide telecommunication links through mobile phones (as in the Grameen Phones in Bangladesh discussed in Box 2),are all successfully owned and operated by women.In Bangladesh, women telephone operators said that the Grameen Phones provide them with a source of income, better status and self-esteem. Similarly, in the Western Solomon Islands, the management of a community-owned micro hydro system by women has meant benefits in terms of lighting, education, increased incomes and empowerment (Box 3). 14 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Will tomorrow be brighter than today?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97376bfa-51e9-41dc-9c92-c8be1c80f785": {"__data__": {"id_": "97376bfa-51e9-41dc-9c92-c8be1c80f785", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4f85f16a7dc12a8f32702406baaa39bdd3bf443d21bfc9eaef184aece8467a0"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee073b54-c5d3-4746-8cb6-d5938d2e2414", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ff213c31530a491d32f73a47a09d3d983a9cdfcf25a7cf04563c9b709f65cc9"}}, "hash": "71dfdcf97d69ecf3ad667d3ef6be6a42db1253a60bfd29d796bc7cead8fae151", "text": "14 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Will tomorrow be brighter than today?

The community-owned micro hydro system (funded by the Australian International Greenhouse Partnerships, Caritas, and the Provincial Government) was officially opened in 2001. The system produces 24 kilowatts of power and a 1.5-kilometre high-voltage transmission line enables the community to sell power to the Provincial Secondary School. For the women of Bulelavata, the energy project has had a profound impact; ranging from the practical, quantifiable advantages of lighting and increased community income to qualitative outcomes such as solidarity and empowerment. The project encompassed project policy support, specific women\u2019s awareness and training workshops, as well as community workshops, (in which women also participated). The electricity project has made the women of Bulelavata more confident and outspoken and they now participate much more in community development activities. 1.5 Gainers yet losers The expansion of energy programmes and energy services does not automatically ensure that men and women will benefit equally in terms of improved incomes, livelihood opportunities or even well-being. A number of studies show that while time-saving from electricity does occur,it does not reduce the overall workload of women,although it does make their work easier. Fuel savings in one area of drudgery can result in increased drudgery in another area (Clancy et al. 2003). When time savings do take place because of the introduction of energy-saving devices, men are more likely to use these savings primarily for recreation and leisure, whereas women are more likely to redirect them to other household chores. In Sri Lanka, women surveyed said that lighting gives them about two extra hours of useful time, which is invested not only in better housework and care of the children, but also in time to rest, socialize and watch television, and sometimes to develop income- generating activities (Matly 2003). In general, women have less access to productivity-enhancing resources, such as labour, collateral, credit facilities, information and training. These inequalities often restrict women\u2019s ability to benefit from available opportunities. Hence, it cannot be assumed a priori that energy interventions that benefit men will necessarily benefit women as well. Special enabling conditions may need to be created to ensure that women are able to access modern energy services and benefit from them equitably. For example, in impoverished, post-conflict and conservative countries like Afghanistan, many \u2018energy-related constraints\u2019 that hinder women from participating in productive activities have their roots in income/poverty and cultural attitudes. In such situations, even if more efficient and cheaper energy services are made available to women, this may relieve them of the drudgery of their household chores, but it is not a given that the time so freed will be used for personal enrichment, education, skill development or even for income generation. Instead, it may be that the women take on additional tasks. It is therefore critical to delve more deeply into the dynamics of the conditions under which energy makes a difference (Dutta et al. 2005). 15 Gender, energy and poverty 1 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Special enabling conditions may need to be created to ensure that women are able to access modern energy services and benefit from them equitably The argument for addressing gender inequality is not simply that it exists in all societies but that it exists at all levels of society. It makes the effects of poverty worse for women and biases the form taken by economic growth. \u2013 Naila Kabeer (2003),Gender Mainstreaming in Poverty Eradication and the Millennium Development Goals The number of people who lived on less than US$1 a day in the Asia- Pacific region in 2003 was 621 million (ADB 2005a).Most of this poverty is concentrated in rural areas. Even though data on poverty is rarely gender segregated (Kelkar and Nathan 2005b), a high proportion of the poor are known to be women. The primary sources of national poverty statistics are income and expenditure data collected through household surveys.This data is used as an indirect measure of access to opportunities and resources for household members. Reliance on such data is inadequate for capturing differences in poverty among women and men since it focuses on poverty estimates for households rather than on those for individuals (UN 2005). Conventional economics sees the household as organized around the pooling of income and meeting the welfare needs of all members. However, studies from different parts of the world suggest that, on the contrary, there are widespread and systematic inequalities within households. These may be related to age, life cycle status, birth order, relationship to household head and other factors. The most pervasive, however, are those related to gender.

In addition, poverty statistics based on income and expenditure data do not assign an economic value to unpaid domestic work or to care-giving activities that are most often performed by women. Most countries in the Asia-Pacific region have a legal framework to support gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, including provisions in the constitution and in the national laws. Yet, women are unable to benefit fully from existing legal provisions due to the 18 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? Gender, energy and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region Even though data on poverty is rarely gender segregated, a high proportion of the poor are thought to be women persistence of traditional practices, the lack of awareness of their legal rights and gaps in law enforcement. Customary practices throughout most of Asia and the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) prevent women from exercising the right to own and control land, which results in their exclusion from the process of rural and agricultural development.In both Asia and the Pacific, (except in a few countries) there is unequal representation of women at all levels in decision-making bodies,from the village or community level to the Parliamentary level. The status of women in most of the region is considerably lower than that of men (see Figures 1 and 2). Some aspects of gender and poverty in the region are summarized below: \u2022 Gender-related Development Index (GDI), an indicator for overall development of women,measures achievements in the same dimensions as the Human Development Index (HDI) and uses the same indicators, but captures inequalities in achievements between women and men.The region accounts for some of the lowest GDIs in the world.Except for Malaysia,the Philippines,China and Sri Lanka,all the study countries fall below the halfway mark among the 140 countries ranked for GDI (UNDP 2005a). \u2022 The Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM),a measure of gender disparities that measures the extent of women\u2019s deprivation in income and decision-making power,is consistently low in the region. Except for Malaysia and the Philippines, all the countries ranked within the region fall in the bottom 20 percent of the 80 countries (worldwide) that have been ranked on GEM (UNDP 2005a). The estimated earned income for women in the region is considerably lower than that for men, often less than half and sometimes even one-third that of men. In Malaysia, Nepal and Indonesia, for example, estimated earned income for women is about half that of men, while in Iran and Pakistan, it is about a third of the income for men. To a large extent, the reason for the low GDP per capita for women is under-reporting of women\u2019s role in the economic sector and their low social status. This is somewhat paradoxical given that when both household and \u2018productive labour\u2019for the market are considered, women work considerably longer hours than men do. This gap is particularly pronounced in poor households. The time that women allocate to agriculture or land-based labour is three to four times greater than that 19 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Customary practices throughout most of Asia and the Pacific Island Countries prevent women from exercising the right to own and control land of their male partners (Mencher 1993, quoted in Kelkar and Nathan 2005). The energy, poverty and gender (EnPoGen) study in Sri Lanka revealed that women get up earlier and are awake for 16 hours or more, of which (excluding food and rest time) they spend more than 13 hours working, to be compared with 10 hours of work for men (Masse and Samaranayake 2002). \u2022 Women\u2019s participation in the workforce in South and South-east Asia is largely restricted to the informal economy.There has not been any substantial movement of women into the formal workforce, i.e. those employed in registered, corporate units with the various benefits that workers expect to get, such as provident fund, medical insurance and paid leave. \u2022 Women are concentrated in the lowest remunerated categories of self-employment and casual wage labour, and bear a far larger share of non-commercial (unpaid) subsistence work (food processing and gathering of food, fuel and water) than men, and that share is rising due to male migration (IFAD 2002). \u2022 There is substantial variation in the percentage of women engaged in economic activities in both Asia and the Pacific region.In Pakistan, for example, the percentage of women who are economically active is 13.7 percent, while in Lao PDR it is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96accc69-5b14-4f3b-8cee-658f9cc277f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "96accc69-5b14-4f3b-8cee-658f9cc277f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f12c56e2b01378cf263247b2a2bb8043a012e71f8704c708b3a4d4853311d1b"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ff6a1a7-0154-4f08-a630-7e7f34273096", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd039197258ad9dabd48f8748e4926c9186b60d6dea4d35bd8437b4936ecd111"}}, "hash": "f174fb9062b9e0bc1fe1307b046697cb2f09c8a6dc262f3de68956e5fd3f0212", "text": "74 percent.

These two variables have been selected because cooking, heating and lighting together constitute the bulk of energy consumption (in rural areas, cooking predominates). Women are therefore impacted by the access to and supply of electricity, as well as factors that influence the availability and efficiency of different kinds of cooking fuels. While transportation also has the potential to influence women\u2019s lives in a variety of ways,data limitations prevent any meaningful discussion of this variable. Commonalities among the countries The 15 countries of Asia8 A total of 30 Asian and Pacific countries8 have been mapped with regard to electrification and cooking fuels, as part of the Rapid Assessment and Gap Analysis exercise, which was one of the initial activities of UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR). The 15 Asian countries vary considerably in terms of geographical locations, income per capita and social and cultural aspects.The 15 PICs also have wide disparities in resources, development levels and GDP per capita. Despite this, a number of commonalities emerge from a comparative analysis of the Asian national reports and the Pacific regional report, with reference to gender issues and access to energy services. \u2022 Most of the discussion on gender issues in energy in the Country Reports is largely qualitative because neither poverty nor energy statistics are disaggregated by gender. This reflects the inadequate attention paid to gender and energy issues in the study countries. 22 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? 8 The countries in Asia include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Iran, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam.

On the other hand, Polynesian and Micronesian countries are on the road to full electrification. Even when electricity is provided by governments on highly subsidized terms, as in Fiji, the supply in the areas not covered by the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA) is often intermittent, irregular or is only available for a few hours each day. In Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Tonga,Tokelau and Tuvalu, nearly all lighting is electric, except for kerosene during outages. Nearly all the rural lighting in Kiribati and much of Tonga is powered by solar energy. The use of kerosene for lighting is common in PICs with largely un-electrified rural areas. In PNG, nearly 30 percent of the rural households still use wood fires as the main source of lighting (in 1996/97). Although the PICs are slowly shifting away from wood to kerosene and even LPG in more affluent communities, wood and other biomass is still the main cooking fuel. Even in the affluent Cook Islands, wood continues to be the main cooking fuel for 11 percent of households. Access to biomass for fuel is not a problem in most rural areas of the PICs, but access is becoming a problem in urbanized atolls and cities such as Port Moresby in PNG and Honiara in the Solomon Islands.Where fuel wood is purchased in urban markets, women may have more free time as they are not out gathering wood, but they also must spread their limited household budgets further to pay for the fuel, and it is the poorer urban households who are the main users of wood for cooking.

The populations vary in size from 1,500 people in Niue to about five million in PNG. Their combined population is approximately eight million people. The proportion of rural population also varies from zero in Nauru to 90 percent in the Solomon Islands.Per capita GDP varies from US$700 in Kiribati to over US$8,000 in Palau (UNDP 1999). Most of these countries rely on traditional fuels for their household energy needs. 2.2 Rural electrification: limited access, irregular supply In all the countries in the region,rural electrification continues to be the largest rural energy programme,both in terms of investment as well as coverage. The main issues in rural electrification are the limited expansion of the grid in most countries, especially to remote areas, erratic and unreliable power supply, which necessitates dependence on multiple fuels for 26 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? 9 These figures have been complied from the WDI database, www.worldbank.org. Rural electrification continues to be the largest rural energy programme, both in terms of investment as well as coverage lighting, and high prices (in many countries), which make electricity unaffordable for the very poor.These issues are particularly relevant in the case of the PICs. In some of the more remote islands in Fiji for instance, supply is often intermittent and is available only for a few hours a day.This poses a serious problem for income-generating enterprises that depend on electricity as well as for households, which are dependent on electricity for lighting and have begun to use modern conveniences like refrigerators. It is now well established that the benefits from rural electrification accrue more to the rich than to the poor. Studies show that rural electrification does not directly reduce poverty by helping the poorest rural people (IDS 2003).10 Most of the benefits from rural electrification go to wealthier people;once connected,the amount of electricity consumed and therefore the benefits obtained depend on the ability to buy electrical equipment, light fixtures, televisions, fans, water heaters, water pumps or motor-driven machines. Rural electrification reduces rural poverty only through a general rise in rural income obtained by productive use.With the exception of irrigation pumping, the productive uses of electricity appear to come about only when other factors are already raising rural and national per capita income (IDS 2003). There is an implicit assumption that the benefits of electricity are gender neutral; however, this is a misplaced notion as women perceive the need for and use of electricity quite differently from men. For example, a study in Indonesia that assessed the impact of rural electrification on poverty and gender equity showed that among the benefits appreciated by women is no longer having to accompany small children at night because lighting allows them to get around without continuously bumping into things (Madon and Gardener 2002). Another highly appreciated benefit was that women no longer had to worry about fires from kerosene lamps. The same study in Sri Lanka revealed that the major benefit to women is the time they save through avoided journeys that they earlier had to make to take the batteries to be charged or to buy kerosene (Masse and Samaranayake 2002). There are some reservations regarding the impact of lighting on women\u2019s well-being. For instance, it is sometimes suggested that if electric light extends working hours into the evening, this adds to women\u2019s already long working day (Clancy 2000).Others hold that electricity helps women to perform a number of chores in light rather than in darkness.

Women perceive the need for and use of electricity quite differently from men One of the few detailed studies with gender-disaggregated data on rural electrification reported that women in rural Bangladesh felt that while electricity had not brought a real reduction in their workload,it had given them greater flexibility (through lighting) in the organization of their work patterns (Barkat et al. 2002). In Housanxi, a recently electrified village in Hubei province in China, women thought that the biggest positive change after electrification was a reduction in time spent looking after pigs, with mechanization of pig fodder cutting and corn grinding (IDS 2003). Women\u2019s resting time also increased substantially. However, this was partly offset by an increase in the time spent working in the fields. This was in part because the time saved from pig-feeding tasks was used for household agricultural work and partly because some men migrated,leaving their agricultural work to women. 2.3 Urban electrification: so near yet so far The provisioning of energy for the poor in urban regions is an area that receives scant attention.In contrast to poor rural residents,the urban poor live next door to modern energy services. However, they can seldom if ever afford electricity, even though most urban areas have access to electricity. In practice, access to electricity by the urban poor is often complex and not always cheap or legal. In many poor urban areas, women-headed households which are often more numerous, are unable to access water or electricity services because the billing systems require formal employment references or a billing address. Poor women seldom own immovable property and their houses are usually not in their names.They tend to be more active in the informal sector and very few have permanent employment. Therefore, they find it extremely difficult to access electricity.Thus, ensuring that women have equal tenure rights to land and other assets is critical to developing equitable access to energy services. Bureaucratic barriers (such as the need for a registered address) can be circumnavigated by the use of informal services, which can also be cheaper than the official providers. However, relying on these informal services can be dangerous, since it often means that connections and electric wiring are installed by untrained people (Cecelski 2005). 28 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? Ensuring that women have equal tenure rights to land and other assets is critical to developing equitable access to energy services The extension of access to electricity is comparatively easier and less capital intensive in urban and semi-urban areas, but ensuring supply is an issue both in rural and urban areas. While there are genuine business obstacles to serving the poor (including poor urban women), such as low energy purchases and unpaid bills, it is still possible to devise innovative programmes. One suggested method would be for regulators to allow energy companies to charge different rates from urban consumers, subsidizing the urban poor and charging higher rates for affluent, high- volume customers to make up the lost revenue (Saghir 2006). It has been suggested that the initial cost of connection, installing meters, etc. be recovered by cross-subsidization over a longer period. Bill collection alternatives such as charge cards and community billing are also alternatives that can be used effectively to extend electricity provisioning to poor women (See Box 4 for a successful initiative from India). In some countries,even though people have access to electricity in urban areas, they continue to rely on wood and charcoal, especially where energy prices are relatively high. Often, kerosene is used for lighting.The high cost of wood in urban areas (where wood is sold) and increasing prices of fossil fuels mean that increasingly higher proportions of income and household budgets are expended on energy. Even where electricity is available, it is often not used (for example, in some of the PICs) partly due to the high capital cost (wiring, installing the meters, buying bulbs and other equipment), the high price of electricity and often unreliable supply. In many cities in Asia and in some of the PICs, irregular supply is a 29 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Box 4: Female-headed households in Ahmedabad slum get electricity Source: Extracted from Ahmedabad Team (2005) The increasing price of fossil fuels means that increasingly", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "310aede2-4c35-4107-b2c0-643e995f46ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "310aede2-4c35-4107-b2c0-643e995f46ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b00ed5d3f1954de87b9517cda58ba53fb1659cf985cd442f4b01d6bcab66f229"}}, "hash": "b00ed5d3f1954de87b9517cda58ba53fb1659cf985cd442f4b01d6bcab66f229", "text": "higher proportions of income and household budgets are expended on energy A successful networking initiative between the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), two NGOs \u2013 SAATH and the Mahila Housing SEWA Trust \u2013 and the Ahmedabad Electricity Company (AEC) has been able to provide legal electricity connections to the residents of the Parivartan Slum in Ahmedabad, India. The Municipality provided tenement security to the residents, NGOs provided loans for one-time connections, and the AEC provided legal electricity connections to 800 households.

In many developing countries, load shedding is a common strategy adopted to meet the problem of insufficient supply in relation to rising demand (Wamukonya 2002).People thus have to use multiple fuels to meet their energy needs and women are required to prepare for any supply problems that might occur. In many countries, power sector reforms have been initiated, resulting in restructuring, commercialization and privatization of the energy sector. The role of the public sector in electricity provisioning is likely to diminish in the future, except as a regulator and facilitator. Liberalization of the petroleum markets in most countries of the region means that governments have less control over pricing and supply in the petroleum sector and, consequently, on the provisioning of services. These developments pose a challenge for energy provisioning in Asia and the Pacific. It is not yet clear whether or not this will lead to greater efficiency and increased access to electricity for the poor and how it will impact poor women. 2.4 Cooking fuel: smoky kitchens and ill health Even though electricity offers many benefits, it does not help address the major energy issue that women in rural areas face: access to a clean, affordable and safe fuel for their daily cooking requirements. More than half the population in developing countries still rely on traditional biomass fuels for cooking and heating and are subject to all the health risks posed by their combustion. In rural areas, cooking is the most important energy need in terms of women\u2019s time and effort. The collection of fuel wood is primarily the responsibility of women in almost all the countries, and the energy and physical cost of collection and the associated health and environmental costs are seldom considered by the household or taken into account at the policy-making level. In all the study countries, there is a dichotomy between the prevalent energy needs for cooking and the focus of energy policies, which are heavily tilted towards electricity.Biomass continues to be the main source of cooking energy in most countries, except for Iran, where LPG is the dominant cooking fuel and is available to most rural families (see Figure 4). In the Philippines, cooking and water heating account for 90 percent of household energy use; fuel wood provides 75 percent of the total energy used in rural areas and more than 25 percent in urban areas (Polestico 2002). 30 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? More than half the population in developing countries still rely on traditional biomass fuels for cooking and heating and are subject to all the health risks posed by their combustion Many women and girls suffer from health problems related to gathering and using traditional fuels. In addition to the time and physical burdens involved in gathering fuel, women suffer serious long-term physical damage from strenuous work without sufficient recuperation time. They are also exposed to a variety of health hazards from cooking over poorly ventilated indoor fires, including respiratory infections, cancers, and eye diseases. Globally, indoor air pollution accounts for 1.6 million premature deaths per year (WHO 2005). Exposure to indoor air pollutants enhances the risk of a range of respiratory illnesses, including lower respiratory infections in children and pulmonary disease, especially in women (See Box 5).

Women typically spend between two to five hours a day in the collection of fuel wood in most countries of the region. For instance in Lao PDR, where 97 percent of the households use wood or charcoal for cooking, a woman who collects wood for a family of five to six people must carry 120 to 150 wood loads per year, (each load weighing 15 to 20 kg). This takes up one to three hours of walking and cutting time every day.Families with little extra income invest in handcarts, which eases the work for women. Men and boys are involved in water and fuel collection when there is a handcart available (Lao Women\u2019s Union 2001).

Women who have regular income-generating work in Lao PDR, for instance, have started thinking of conserving firewood in order to save labour and time by using charcoal and sawdust stoves, which have started appearing in the local markets. In houses where women undertake income-generating activities, families carry out planned wood collection and stockpiling so that they can cut and transport large quantities of wood at one time using carts or rented cars. For example, in Viengsay village, where women contribute significantly to family incomes through embroidery and weaving, the division of labour in the family has changed and the whole family is involved in fuel wood collection. The husband of the fastest weaver in the village has taken over all the household jobs (Kelkar and Nathan, quoted in Dutta 2005). The type of fuel used increases in cleanliness,convenience,efficiency and cost as people move up the energy ladder. Animal dung is lowest on this ladder,and the fuel progresses in ascending order to crop residues,wood, charcoal,kerosene,gas and finally,to electricity.In most countries covered by this study, within biomass, the primary fuel used is wood, with the exception of Bangladesh, where agricultural residues are the predominant fuel (61 percent). In China, too, crop residues account for 54 percent of the biomass used for energy. Countries like Lao PDR, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Cambodia rely almost entirely on wood as a source of biomass. In Nepal, also, the dependence on fuel wood is high. In addition, in Cambodia and Lao PDR, the reliance on biomass for fuel needs is extremely high. In Pakistan, the share of animal dung in total biomass energy is as much as 19 percent.11 32 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? 11 Data compiled in IEA (2005) Women typically spend between two to five hours a day in the collection of fuel wood in most countries of the region The impact of indoor air pollution on health has been well documented, but there are other costs as well.Studies by WHO show that women often carry loads of between 25 to 30 kgs and sometimes up to 50 kgs. This leads to postural defects and puts pressure on the spine, as women need to slant their bodies in the opposite direction to counterbalance the load on their heads (WHO 2000). Furthermore, deforestation means that women have to traverse longer distances for fuel wood and water. 33 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Box 5: Indoor air pollution: smoke kills Source: Compiled and extracted from WHO (2005) The impact of indoor air pollution on health has been well documented, but there are other costs as well Cooking and heating with solid fuels such as wood, animal dung and agricultural waste, on open fires or stoves without chimneys leads to indoor air pollution.This indoor smoke contains a range of health-damaging pollutants, including small soot or dust particles that are able to penetrate deep into the lungs. In poorly ventilated dwellings, indoor smoke can exceed acceptable levels for small particles in outdoor air 100-fold. Exposure is particularly high among women and children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth. The World Health Organization (WHO) has assessed the contribution of a range of risk factors to the burden of disease and revealed indoor air pollution as the 8th most important risk factor, responsible for 2.7 percent of the global burden of disease. Globally, indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is responsible for 1.6 million deaths due to pneumonia, chronic respiratory disease and lung cancer, with the overall disease burden", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1eebeb0-5f9c-477e-801e-1ef7e4e3744f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1eebeb0-5f9c-477e-801e-1ef7e4e3744f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "321e88e989e2ab5aa89c3c5c12a3ef486ed11a5af32ee24101b700911aa33624"}}, "hash": "321e88e989e2ab5aa89c3c5c12a3ef486ed11a5af32ee24101b700911aa33624", "text": "exceeding the burden from outdoor air pollution five-fold. In high-mortality developing countries, indoor smoke is responsible for an estimated 3.7 percent of the overall disease burden,making it the most lethal killer after malnutrition,unsafe sex and lack of safe water and sanitation. There is consistent evidence that exposure to indoor air pollution increases the risk of pneumonia among children under five years and chronic respiratory disease and lung cancer (in relation to coal use) among adults over 30 years old. While more than two-thirds of indoor smoke deaths from acute lower respiratory infections in children occur in Africa and South-East Asia, over 50 percent of the deaths due to indoor air pollution occur in the Western Pacific region. In most societies, women are in charge of cooking and they spend between three and seven hours per day near the stove preparing food. Fifty-nine percent of all indoor air pollution-attributable deaths are of females. Young children are often carried on their mother\u2019s back or kept close to the warm hearth. Consequently, infants spend many hours breathing indoor smoke during their first year of life, when their developing airways make them particularly vulnerable to hazardous pollutants. As a result, 56 percent of all indoor air pollution-attributable deaths occur in children under five years of age. In China (Yunan) and in other parts of Asia, women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation as well as status in the labour force is linked to the adoption of new fuels and appliances.The low opportunity cost of women\u2019s labour in rural areas limits the adoption of improved stoves,while women\u2019s entry into income-earning activities appears to promote a fuel transition.While the severely negative health impacts of biomass fuels make public subsidy of alternatives desirable, this will not necessarily result in fuel switching by households so long as the value of women\u2019s labour remains low (Kelkar and Nathan 2005). Thus, in the foreseeable future, the probability of eliminating the dependence on traditional energy sources (especially fuel wood) in rural areas is negligible. In some areas, this dependence may decline somewhat, with the supply of conventional commercial energy and/or decentralized alternatives like biogas, solar power and other non- conventional energies, but biomass will continue to be the fuel of \u2018first choice\u2019in most of Asia and the Pacific. Improving efficiency and reducing health risks: the improved cook stoves programme The high dependence on biomass and the price that women pay (in terms of time and drudgery and ill health) make it imperative that energy policy in Asia and the Pacific focus on improving efficiency and reducing health risks in the kitchen. Developing effective programmes for disseminating improved stoves is one way to reduce the health risks caused by indoor air pollution, which are faced largely by women and children. Relatively simple, inexpensive stoves can reduce the fuel needed for cooking by as much as 30 percent. Fuel-efficient stoves can reduce the aggregate demand for wood, easing pressure on the surrounding land and conserving poor households\u2019 scarce cash.Other benefits are the time saved in fuel wood collection and cooking, reduction in drudgery and a reduction in indoor air pollution, leading to better health. The most successful cook stove programme has been in China, where after 20 years of popularizing the technology, there were 185 million ICS-user households in 1998 (out of a national total of 236 million rural households).11 China focused efforts on regions where there were biomass fuel shortages or where such fuels were commercially available, 34 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? Relatively simple, inexpensive stoves can reduce the fuel needed for cooking by as much as 30 percent 11 Data compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture, China. and subsidies were provided for supporting services rather than for the cook stoves themselves.The programmes ensured significant interaction between cook stove designers and users and relied on mass-produced cook stove components to reduce costs. The key lessons from the China experience are: (a) governments should promote private-sector initiatives to develop and market improved stoves in rural areas; and (b) programmes must be carefully targeted to those who will benefit the most (Saghir 2006). The energy sector can play a significant role in reducing environmental damage and other harmful effects by introducing renewable energy sources,supplying modern cooking fuels at affordable prices,substituting cleaner fuels for dirty ones and increasing energy efficiency. Much of the presently used bioenergy originates from various types of agricultural and forestry residues, however, increasingly, different kinds of energy crops (such as sugarcane, sugar beet and maize) and plantations are 35 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Addressing gender concerns in energy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85652d5f-9f68-4a48-85b8-5bff66b96269": {"__data__": {"id_": "85652d5f-9f68-4a48-85b8-5bff66b96269", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddcfe9eeba4ae5fabe3296821add08e0937676aed38c968f7167b41b798bddf5"}, "3": {"node_id": "09253aa4-9715-4011-afc8-bc10f27535ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d6bb073661bf99db378e8db8a95bf72cb3c07be4c8d7dc0b23ee648eb94d301"}}, "hash": "3833df7221844ac2996a248b92c0119f10664efb6c48b0ee342e20da44186316", "text": "for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Box 6: Commercialization of efficient charcoal stoves in Cambodia Source: Compiled from Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy,UK and CFSP,Cambodia The energy sector can play a significant role in reducing environmental damage and other harmful effects About 95 percent of Cambodians cook with biomass fuels. Cambodia\u2019s great natural biodiversity is threatened by uncontrolled wood consumption. While much of this demand is for timber, a significant amount is turned into charcoal, which is the preferred cooking fuel in cities, used by 40 percent of the population in the capital, Phnom Penh. The area of forests is diminishing but the price of charcoal has hardly increased over the last ten years, reflecting a thriving trade, lack of taxes and other constraining factors. One way of reducing the unsustainable wood consumption is by reducing the demand for charcoal. The Cambodian Fuelwood Saving Project (CFSP) has developed a cheap charcoal stove, the New Lao Stove, which uses 22 percent less charcoal than the traditional \u2018Lao\u2019 stoves, which are traditionally used in Cambodia. (The word \u2018Lao\u2019 is derived from the Chinese term \u2018Ang Lao\u2019 which means \u2018portable cooking stove made of clay\u2019). CFSP has worked with stove users and producers to develop a stove that is more efficient and durable than the conventional bucket-type stoves because of better insulation, controlled air flow and a durable outer bucket. Over 130,000 New Lao Stoves have been produced and sold by 14 entrepreneurs over the past three years. Although a New Lao Stove costs about three times as much as a traditional stove, users are willing to pay for one because they recover the difference in the price within two months through savings on the purchase of charcoal. A network of distributors and retailers has been established and a trade organization set up that oversees pricing and quality. expected to provide the bulk of biomass for energy production.This is an area of particular relevance to PICs and will have a significant impact on women\u2019s energy requirements in the future. 36 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? Box 7: Biogas Sector Partnership in Nepal: small scale can be big Source: Compiled from Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy,UK About 80 percent of the 4.2 million households in Nepal use fuel wood, cattle-dung cakes and agricultural residues for cooking, and kerosene for lighting. Demand for fuel wood substantially exceeds the rate of regrowth, and this is leading to degradation of the land and damage to vital watersheds. The Biogas Sector Partnership (BSP) in Nepal installed over 124,000 domestic biogas plants in Nepal between 1992 and 2005. The plants use cattle manure to provide biogas for cooking and lighting. In addition, about 75 percent of the plants incorporate toilets. The biogas plants replace nearly all the use of fuel wood and make cooking easier,cleaner and safer. In 20 percent of households, biogas provides safer lighting as well. This saving of unsustainable fuel wood use also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. The provision of toilets improves sanitation, and the effluent from the biogas plant is valuable organic compost. The use of cattle dung to generate biogas is well known in the Indian subcontinent, but in no other place has it been used with such success as in Nepal. Biogas already serves about one million people (four pecent of the population of Nepal),and the biogas sector provides about 11,000 permanent jobs in the country. A major benefit from the programme is the reduction in the consumption of fuel wood. BSP estimates that the average rural household of seven people uses about three tonnes of fuel wood per year for cooking (1.2 kg/day per person), so the plants installed to date save the use of about 375,000 tonnes of firewood per year. There is visible evidence of forest regrowth in Nepal,brought about mainly by an active programme of tree planting, and also by the reduction of unsustainable use through the biogas programme. Fuel wood collection takes considerably more time than collecting and mixing dung. Research commissioned by BSP found that households with biogas plants save an average of three hours per day. This time savings has a huge impact on the lives of women and girls \u2013 women use the extra time for income generation, such as weaving, farm work and education.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09253aa4-9715-4011-afc8-bc10f27535ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "09253aa4-9715-4011-afc8-bc10f27535ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddcfe9eeba4ae5fabe3296821add08e0937676aed38c968f7167b41b798bddf5"}, "2": {"node_id": "85652d5f-9f68-4a48-85b8-5bff66b96269", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3833df7221844ac2996a248b92c0119f10664efb6c48b0ee342e20da44186316"}}, "hash": "3d6bb073661bf99db378e8db8a95bf72cb3c07be4c8d7dc0b23ee648eb94d301", "text": "2.5 Renewable energy technology: limited experience with gender issues In most Asia-Pacific countries, women\u2019s energy needs have been addressed primarily through special programmes like the introduction of more efficient and less smoky stoves, biogas plants and solar cookers.

Expansion of sustainable rural energy systems is seen as an entry point for economic development and poverty alleviation. The Programme stresses community mobilization, bottom-up participatory planning and decentralized decision-making. Productive income-generating activities are targeted as the intended end uses of the energy supplied, and skill training is provided to promote agricultural and home-based businesses.The project ensures equity and empowerment of both women and men from every target household through the establishment of separate women\u2019s and men\u2019s community organizations, which form the basic functional unit of the programme. The equal opportunities offered have had a visible and positive impact in mobilizing women and integrating them into mainstream activities. The women in community organizations have a distinct voice in local affairs, and their capability for independent and collective action has increased. Two of five micro hydro schemes in a remote district in western Nepal (an area where women have traditionally had extremely low social status) are chaired by women. The project has meant reduced drudgery in household tasks and an increase in productive and community roles. The success in the region of the RET programmes has been limited. The Biogas Support Programme in Nepal, one of the more successful biogas programmes in the region, covers about four percent of the households at the national level so far (see Box 7).The region offers some experience on gender-energy-poverty linkages through innovative projects like the Rural Energy Development Programme (REDP) Nepal (see Box 8), the women\u2019s cooperatives in Char Montaz, Bangladesh (see Box 9), and the micro hydel projects of Chitral (see Box 10), all of which have been successful in terms of meeting the needs of women and empowering them. These projects are, however, few and far between, and the gender impacts of energy interventions such as grid-based electricity, SPV and micro hydro are typically neither recognized nor monitored. The REDP, Nepal and the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme are among the few integrated energy projects that have systematically looked at gender concerns within the programme framework and have put in place effective mechanisms to enable women to participate meaningfully and benefit from the programme. 38 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today?

Today, more than 1,000 rural households are using these lamps in the remote islands of Bangladesh. Even in the PICs,where there is substantial potential for the development of renewable energy sources, the share of renewable energy in total energy supply remains small.This may be due to a lack of information and an absence of local technical and institutional capacity in renewable energy technologies, and most significantly, inadequate financing and investment opportunities for their development. The production of cleaner alternative energy sources, such as biofuel from sugarcane, coconuts or other biomass products, is currently being researched and pursued (ENERGIA,2006).The use of such resources will assist in reducing land degradation, as they can be planted on degraded or unused land (particularly the high-yielding varieties of short rotation species) or restored coconut groves. Over the long-run, such initiatives have the potential to impact women\u2019s lives by providing opportunities for employment and access to cleaner fuels. 39 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Box 10: Microhydel programmes in Chitral improve lives and businesses Source: Adapted from: Aga Khan Rural Support Programme,Regional Programme, Shahi Qila District,Chitral Even in the PICs, the share of renewable energy in total energy supply remains small The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) has been implementing a large number of microhydel programmes in the remote, hilly villages of Pakistan. The project communities are scattered and isolated and far removed from conventional electricity supplies. They have traditionally used smoky and unreliable pinewood torches and more recently, costly kerosene lamps for lighting. In the northern province of Chitral, AKRSP has established 172 microhydel power units, benefiting more than 20,000 households. The projects are implemented, maintained and managed by village management committees in which women play an active role. The villagers have been linked to various AKDN (Aga Khan Development Network) programmes and government institutions, which has enabled many of them to start small businesses. The programme has a strong emphasis on women\u2019s capacity building. Availability of hydel power has improved women\u2019s economic productivity in many ways, directly by increasing incomes and by improving the quality of life and reducing the drudgery of labour-intensive tasks. 40 Gender and poverty in the Asia-Pacific region 2 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? 2.6 Credit and microfinance to meet energy needs The availability of credit and finance is critical to enabling women\u2019s participation in using improved energy supplies. The promotion of energy systems for income-generating purposes, and the adaptation of a credit scheme to reduce the down-payment requirements and extend the payment periods could expand the market for the systems, bringing down costs and making them more accessible to women and less- affluent borrowers. Bangladesh\u2019s Grameen Bank is the most well-known of all the micro-credit programmes that target women. Realizing the critical role of financing for energy provisioning,Grameen Bank has set up a special non-profit affiliate, Grameen Shakti, to act as a supplier of energy technologies \u2013 primarily solar home systems. Unlike the Grameen Bank, the Grameen Shakti finance programme is not specifically targeted towards women,and the customers are generally the wealthier members of the community (See Box 11). In order to make credit programmes accessible to women, it is important to design programmes that cater to their needs and the amounts that are borrowed kept small, with frequent and flexible repayment schedules. Low transaction costs in time and money,easy procedures for application, and the use of informal channels that are easily accessible to women are other factors that make microfinance work (Clancy and Dutta 2005). Another example of best practice in interventions for financing energy and income-generating projects in rural and urban areas is the UNDP- funded ENSIGN project implemented in eight countries in Asia. Micro- credit banks and institutions were used as the channel for funds to reach micro-entrepreneurs.

This includes most rural areas and extends as far as the fringes of Dhaka. Grameen Shakti was established in 1996 to promote, develop and supply renewable energy technologies to rural households in Bangladesh. It seeks to improve the livelihoods of people who cannot access grid electricity. Providing energy: Grameen Shakti has sold and installed over 65,000 solar home-systems (SHS) in rural Bangladesh, and brought major benefits to its users. By selling SHS, Grameen Shakti has provided lighting, communications (especially mobile phone charging) and TV, and increased employment opportunities. It is the largest single installer of SHS in Bangladesh. The technology: SHS are small, stand-alone electrical systems.They consist of a photovoltaic (PV) module, which generates electricity from sunlight; a rechargeable battery, which stores electricity so that it can be used during both day and night; a charge controller, which prevents the battery from being over-charged or deep-discharged; four to six fluorescent lamps; and wiring and fixtures. Microfinance: This is realized by providing microfinance with support from Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) and the World Bank. This generates a cash pool which is \u2018recycled\u2019 to make further loans. Users pay an initial deposit followed by monthly installments lasting two to three years.The cost of a 50 WP system is about Taka 24,000,which is equivalent to about half the average annual income of a rural household.The customer pays a deposit of between 15 to 25 percent and the rest of the amount is given as a loan after signing a contract. Contracts are signed by either men or women. Grameen Shakti seeks to sign women where possible, since they are in the home more than men and therefore use the SHS more. Training women: Grameen Shakti has started a network of technology centres throughout the country to manage the installation and maintenance of SHS locally. It emphasizes the importance of technicians who know local customs working through local branches and has trained 2,000 (mainly female) technicians. It aims to install 100,000 systems by 2006 and 1,000,000 systems by 2015. 44 Missing links:policies,plans and constraints to enterprise 3 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? Poverty is \u2018gendered\u2019because women and men experience poverty differently \u2013 and unequally \u2013 and become poor through different, though related, processes. \u2013 Naila Kabeer (2003), from Gender mainstreaming in poverty eradication and MDGs: A handbook for policy makers 3.1 Inadequate attention to gender in national energy policies and institutional framework While the governments in the Asia-Pacific region recognize the need for gender equality and increasing women\u2019s representation and are committed to gender equity, this commitment does not translate into action. Policies and programmes suffer from a lack of incorporation of gender concerns. If gender is considered at all, it remains a separate component or an addendum, without any link to main policy and programmes. Energy policy in most countries tends to concentrate on commercial energy carriers:electricity,coal,gas and petroleum products.These do not touch the lives of the rural poor or women in any significant way. Investments tend to be directed to electricity and fossil fuels. The recognition of the problems that people face at the grassroots level is almost entirely absent; therefore, the problem is not addressed in energy policies. The energy-poverty links are seldom addressed and gender concerns are completely sidelined.Thus, there is an urgent need to bring the issues that concern women to centre stage. Energy policies require gender mainstreaming, a recognition of the impact of energy on women, an articulation of the issues that affect them and, in response to this understanding, the designing of appropriate policies and interventions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7e1fb98-ae50-413b-8836-f3c5e4096895": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7e1fb98-ae50-413b-8836-f3c5e4096895", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9268d42909912f4949cbf062b394117cf3f159330f0eb6cdadd5a835582a9e47"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ec80ea1-5443-493b-92c0-78cbd0177959", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8aff75f0be04516c6c0452b80213c92e39ea392737a4ab6b669f7c119bcb1f79"}}, "hash": "e295994675258b8648b4e5a43e0d54855a660db60456214f17d45f2de5358c59", "text": "3.2 Limitations of existing planning, monitoring and evaluation frameworks to reflect gender concerns In energy programmes, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) typically measures quantifiable information, such as the number of new-grid electricity connections, number of villages covered or number of renewable energy systems installed.

The reasons for this lack of information and understanding are twofold. First, in most countries, the current M&E procedures are concentrated at the central level, while gender- and poverty-related processes and impacts are best monitored at decentralized levels. The role of decentralized local institutions in M&E is typically restricted to data collection, completing assessment forms and questionnaires, and sending them upwards for consolidation and reporting.At the same time, existing energy institutions do not have sufficient capacities, including knowledge of modern tools and approaches, to develop and implement M&E systems that are gender and poverty sensitive. The Country Gap Assessments completed by UNDP\u2019s REP-PoR show there is little or no gender training, nor the use of gender analysis for planning, implementation and M&E in the mainstream energy sector. Gender-sensitive project planning and M&E emerged as a common capacity-building need in all the Gap Assessment Country Reports. 3.3 Constraints in promoting energy entrepreneurship among women Within the Asia-Pacific region, women operate a large number of micro and small-scale enterprises, particularly in the informal sector. These enterprises tend to be concentrated around a narrow range of activities, such as food-processing industries and service-sector activities, with relatively low rates of return as compared to men\u2019s activities. This is in part because women tend to work in unskilled manual work and are often not registered, while men work in skilled manual work or management.Women often run income-generating activities from home since it enables them to combine productive tasks with reproductive tasks, such as childcare. Women\u2019s micro-enterprises are also often heat-intensive (food processing), labour-intensive, and/or light-intensive (home-based cottage industries with work in evenings).As a result,lack of adequate energy supplies for these activities affects women\u2019s ability to operate these micro-enterprises profitably and safely (Clancy 2000). Some important challenges in providing energy services to women\u2019s enterprises are: \u2022 Informal and unorganized nature of enterprises: Women-headed enterprises are often located in the home, and these cottage industries tend to be overlooked by agencies because they can be indistinguishable from other household activities. Women often run income-generating activities from home since it enables them to combine productive tasks with reproductive tasks, such as childcare 46 Missing links:policies,plans and constraints to enterprise 3 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? \u2022 Heavy reliance on process heat: The majority of enterprises operated by women use process heat, usually generated from purchased wood or charcoal. \u2022 High use of women\u2019s energy: The tasks in women\u2019s enterprises (e.g. spice and grain pounding) typically are physically demanding and time-consuming. Much could be done to reduce the demands on women\u2019s physical labour by the substitution of their labour by machines. \u2022 Role of complementary inputs:Energy is one of the many inputs that influence the performance of small and medium enterprises. Women\u2019s enterprises are affected more because of the additional barriers they face in optimizing available opportunities. There are social and practical constraints related to ownership and control over productive resources,e.g.women are typically excluded/marginalized from decision making. The ability of poor women to generate livelihoods is also constrained by high marketing costs. In addition, the informal nature of these industries makes it difficult for them to access credit, equipment, market information, technical training and other support services.

The previous discussion points to the need to extend energy provisioning across most of Asia and the Pacific,both in electricity and in cooking fuels, including LPG, kerosene and renewable fuels. Given the high complementarities between energy and development, energy and gender equity,and the impact that energy has on other basic services like water and sanitation, energy is pivotal to poverty eradication strategies and measures directed at achieving the MDGs. Access to energy is both a development issue and a gender issue because it impacts men and women in different ways.If the current situation continues,the number of people without access to electricity in 2030 will be around 1.4 billion, (only 200 million less than at present), and those that rely on traditional biomass for cooking fuel needs will be 2.6 billion, which is more than the number who use traditional biomass today (Saghir 2006).Women will be disproportionately affected. 4.1 Conclusions \u2022 While a number of studies point to the links between gender, energy and poverty, there is need for further research to document exactly the processes and results of energy interventions. Energy is an enabler and can be a catalyst in the right conditions. What use is made of energy and whether or not women are able to take advantage of energy services (in increasing incomes, reducing drudgery and improving access to education and better health) depends on a number of factors, including social attitudes, culture and the enterprise of women themselves. Furthermore, there is a knowledge gap in the gender-energy-poverty nexus. Specific detailed studies that assess more than the initial impact of energy interventions are required before policy makers can design effective intervention strategies. In recent years, a substantial amount of research has been done, but more empirical work is needed before clear links can be established. \u2022 The absence of gender-disaggregated data regarding energy use, supply and impact is a major hindrance towards applying methods and tools for incorporating a gender perspective in project 48 Conclusions and the way forward 4 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? Conclusions and the way forward Access to energy is both a development issue and a gender issue because it impacts men and women in different ways design and implementation.Lack of data is a key reason why there is an absence of the gender perspective at the macro level. It is also important to collect information on intra-household relationships and behaviour, as well as cultural and social attitudes, so as to fully understand the linkages between energy, gender and poverty. \u2022 The inherent inequities between urban and rural areas,between rich and poor people, between men and women, need to be kept in mind in formulating strategies and policies. These differences in needs and socio-economic profiles will impact how energy is used and the kind of fuel that is used. Any strategy aimed at reducing poverty (especially in women-headed households) must have a built-in energy component deemed essential for improved well-being, opportunity and access. \u2022 An integrated approach is required to address the issues of wood energy, cooking and health while recognizing the interrelationships and issues.The environmental and health impacts of the high dependence on biomass in a large number of countries cannot be overstressed. It is important for people and governments to recognize these hazards and develop sustainable energy programmes, more efficient stoves and provide cleaner fuels so that the health of women and children can be protected.The poorer the household, the greater the use of inefficient fuels and systems and the greater the risk of ill health and fatality. Any action to reduce this dependence will have a major impact on the health of women and children and bring about a stream of environmental benefits as well. \u2022 In addition, it has been stressed that energy policy needs to recognize women\u2019s specific needs for water pumping, agricultural processing, security, work productivity and health, and the trade-offs between their domestic and income-generating activities. For example, street lighting, which improves security, has a greater impact on women\u2019s lives than that of men.

Access to credit is important for improving access to energy, but gender differences also need to be addressed. The experience from micro-credit schemes targeted at women is relevant,but credit alone cannot help in poverty reduction,in the absence of other supporting measures like training in income-generating enterprises. \u2022 Current research shows that a participatory approach is the key to success. A project is more likely to succeed if it involves all the stakeholders in conceptualization and at the design stage and continues to do so in the implementation and evaluation stages as well. Both men and women should articulate their needs and concerns; policy makers then need to understand the gender- differentiated systems of access and control before they can make policies that give the desired results. It is important to focus on gender relations, including inequities in the access to resources, and then design appropriate energy programmes. 4.2 The way forward Develop and use poverty- and gender-sensitive project planning and monitoring and evaluation. An overwhelming need for capacity building and training at the national and local levels in gender mainstreaming and the designing of gender-sensitive policies and programmes is obvious from the Country Gap Assessment Reports prepared by UNDP\u2019s REP-PoR. Gender mainstreaming in energy project planning procedures requires that participatory approaches, tools and techniques should be used throughout the project cycle to ensure that all stakeholders are properly accounted for in the project. There is a body of knowledge available on gender mainstreaming in other sectors such as water and sanitation and agriculture. Some work on gender mainstreaming has been done in the energy sector as well.UNDP, in collaboration with ENERGIA, has developed Gender and Energy for Sustainable Development: A Toolkit and Resource Guide. ENERGIA has also developed a set of tools for integrating gender considerations into project planning. There are other resources, such as the framework for designing, monitoring, and evaluating rural electrification projects developed under the EnPoGen project, elements of which were tested 50 Conclusions and the way forward 4 Will tomorrow be brighter than today? It is important to focus on gender relations, including inequities in the access to resources, and then design appropriate energy programmes and applied in the preparation of the World Bank/GEF Cambodia Rural Energy Project, and the Impact Evaluation Methodology and Indicators Development by the Global Village Energy partnership (GVEP). These resources need to be reviewed and adapted for energy-poverty initiatives that are implemented in the Asia-Pacific region. Build capacities on gender mainstreaming at national and local levels. Capacity building needs to involve a wide spectrum of people, from the community level to project implementers and policy makers. Capacity building for gender mainstreaming needs to focus on: (a) Increasing awareness, knowledge and skills of development practitioners to integrate gender concerns into energy policies, programmes and projects; and (b) Building skills of a critical mass of men and women in the mainstream energy sector who will be involved in developing policies, programmes and practices that can impact women\u2019s energy choices. Capacity building for gender mainstreaming should be considered at the following levels: \u2022 National level: It is crucial to increase policy makers\u2019 sensitivity to gender issues. At the national level, capacity building may mean promoting and facilitating the involvement of women\u2019s organizations in decision-making processes and expanding development opportunities for their members. At this level, capacity-building efforts need to make use of advocacy backed by data and facts. Gender training should be made mandatory for all departments of the government. \u2022 Implementers of energy programmes: There is a critical need for gender training of staff that work in the energy sector and on the projects. At the project level, capacity building can mean learning new skills and gaining confidence in defining community problems and designing appropriate solutions. 51 Conclusions and the way forward 4 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region Gender training should be made mandatory for all departments of the government \u2022 Village communities: Sensitization of men is extremely important for effective participation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f5f2639-13c1-4183-9a20-26d27b0f9ac7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f5f2639-13c1-4183-9a20-26d27b0f9ac7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Will Tomorrow Be Brighter than Today?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/will-tomorrow-be-brighter-today", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ee58aca633d29fffffdcd77c58c2a45113644ee2a69fbe0c8ee9c955fb167ba"}}, "hash": "9ee58aca633d29fffffdcd77c58c2a45113644ee2a69fbe0c8ee9c955fb167ba", "text": "of women in energy programmes.

Furthermore, this feedback must be used to adjust programme strategy. Recognize sub-regional variations. The Asia-Pacific region reflects great diversity both in terms of natural resource base and energy consumption patterns as well as in socio-cultural systems, including gender relations, which are determined by class, caste, ethnicity, age, religion, culture, size and location. Rapid economic growth in countries like Malaysia and the Philippines has meant changes in consumption patterns that approach patterns of consumption in industrialized countries. These two countries have also made progress in improving the well-being of women and in reducing gender disparities in income and access to productive resources, education and health care. In both countries, economic growth has been accompanied by the greater participation of women in the formal workforce and in a range of other activities. On the other hand, in Afghanistan and Cambodia, there are high gender imbalances and the consequences of traditional attitudes are clearly manifest in the significant gender inequities in educational attainment and levels of literacy, in the rates of child labour, access to public services, and representation in decision-making positions. Most of the PICs have small, highly dispersed land areas and populations that are distanced from world markets, with narrow resource bases and primary commodity dependent production options. Many of these countries are remote, with small land areas and fragile land and ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to environmental threats and natural disasters, especially in the small islands and low-lying atolls.With the exception of PNG, they are sparsely populated small landmasses dispersed over large distances in the Pacific Ocean. Typically, variations within the countries are even wider than the variations between them. Many of these island economies face the same challenges common to developing countries:poverty and socio-economic inequalities within the population, unemployment, dependence on primary commodities for export earnings, and high external indebtedness. Many face high transportation and communication costs and have difficulty benefiting from economies of scale without access to export markets,and most have limited human, institutional and financial capacity and face 53 Conclusions and the way forward 4 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region The Asia-Pacific region reflects great diversity both in terms of natural resource base and energy consumption patterns as well as in socio-cultural systems, including gender relations ever-increasing demographic and economic pressure on existing natural resources and ecosystems.The limited land areas in these countries, their fragile ecosystems, the pressure of growing population and rising unemployment combined with low energy access and high cost of provisioning requires specifically designed interventions.

The arrangement makes use of a credit scheme, where VWU markets SELCO\u2019s systems and administers consumer loans provided by VBARD, while SELCO provides systems and is responsible for service. The VWU has been active in the promotion of solar home systems in rural areas through its extensive network of 11 million members.VWU is in charge of marketing, motivating households, developing material on basic maintenance, and conducting solar home demonstrations. It is also responsible for reporting problem areas that require troubleshooting, seeking support of government bodies, and identifying new project implementation sites. VWU operates through its commune offices, allowing it to respond better to consumer needs. Its presence instills confidence in rural customers. Many of the local technicians responsible for installing the solar home systems are women. Networking is a particularly useful form of strengthening capabilities because it provides a means of spreading new ideas and sharing experiences to enhance the available knowledge base and increase expertise in energy management and technologies.

Malaysia Initiate projects on integrated energy inputs to women-owned and operated enterprises. Document gender specific impacts and lessons on productivity and income gains from use of electricity in existing enterprises in rural areas, like rice mills, oil mills, weaving enterprises, batik and handicrafts, fish processing and agro-processing industries. The Government has set up funds for small enterprises in rural areas and should encourage these lending institutions to include energy in their loan portfolios. Philippines Undertake capacity development for developing, implementing and monitoring cross-sectoral (including gender) linkages within ongoing energy initiatives. Provide business development and entrepreneurship training support to women entrepreneurs. Energy entrepreneurship models that are in pilot stages in different parts of the country, such as Palawan and Aklan, have different experiences regarding the viability,the involvement of women and the resulting benefits.These need to be analysed from a gender perspective.

Through this project, the women and youth of the village have become empowered through the technical training (in terms of managing the project) and the extra income earned, which pays for education and other needs.The success of this project is attributed to the participatory approach and involvement of all groups, women, youth and men in the project. traditionally been seen, particularly by developers of technology, as only passive users and consumers of energy. Yet, women have substantial accumulated knowledge and experience (gained from using different technologies) and a clear understanding of what meets their needs. Drawing on women\u2019s experiences and working in partnership with them to develop technological solutions will ensure that these solutions have a sustained use and a viable market, since they match the needs of users who are prepared to invest their limited cash resources to acquire them. Thus,with appropriate training,women can be good energy entrepreneurs. The \u2018telephone ladies\u2019 of Bangladesh and the success of Grameen Shakti, the Multi-functional Platform in Mali, and the ENSIGN project are only some of the many success stories that support this statement. An evaluation of the available literature, empirical evidence and the Gap Analysis of the Country Reports for Asia and the Pacific, show that provisioning of energy and energy services has a bundling effect and can substantially change the lives of people in general and of women and girls in particular. However, the needs of women and the impact of energy provisioning and supply on their lives is seldom, if ever, taken into account in the formulation of policy, or in the design and monitoring of programmes. Energy policy in most countries does not address the concerns and requirements of women in any significant way, although many countries have begun to recognize the issue and make appropriate changes in policy documents. There are a number of successful initiatives that have changed women\u2019s lives substantially and have brought empowerment and increased well-being, but the impact has been limited; therefore, there is an urgent need for scaling up. A conscious effort at gender mainstreaming both at the policy and project level is required. In addition to interventions that address the specific needs of women, gender sensitization and training continues to be a big gap. Gender budgeting12 is another tool that can be effectively used to highlight the limited access that women have to energy programmes. Access to affordable and regular energy services is thus critical if countries in the region want to meet their MDG targets and ensure that tomorrow is indeed brighter than today for their women, who hold up at least half the sky. 61 Conclusions and the way forward 4 Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region 12 Gender Budget Initiatives or Gender-Responsive Budgets are tools and processes designed to facilitate a gender analysis in the formulation of government budgets and the allocation of resources.Gender budgets are not separate budgets for women or for men.They are attempts to break down or disaggregate the government\u2019s mainstream budget according to its impacts on women and men. Access to affordable and regular energy services is critical if countries in the region want to meet their MDG targets and ensure that tomorrow is indeed brighter than today for women 63 References ADB (Asian Development Bank). 2005a.

ix viii Foreword The issue of Pacific Islanders who have been forcefully repatriated for criminal offences abroad has been the focus of many debates amongst international organizations, governments and those in the academic fields for some time, however, little has been done to enable inclusive and effective dialogue on the topic and open the space for a more collaborative and comprehensive responses to the challenges. UNDP Pacific Center (UNDP PC) through its Crisis Prevention and Recovery (CPR) Unit has long been a leader in the Pacific on efforts to develop a regional human security framework. This Unit seeks out opportunities to broaden perspectives and understanding of the security issues that underlie crises and conflicts in our region and produce tools to prevent or address them. UNDP Pacific Centre through the CPR Unit recognizes the importance of contributing to peace and security by enabling diverse social actor\u2019s access to forums and institutions to share knowledge and cooperate across political or sectarian lines. To further open an inclusive dialogue on the topic of deportation, the CPR Unit hired a technical expert to advise governments on multidisciplinary approaches to resettlement and reintegration of individuals forcefully repatriated for criminal offenses. UNDP PC through the CPR Unit aims to work to strengthen institutional capacity, approaches, policies and interventions towards human security in the region, and to support national governments and regional organisations, in line with the Pacific Plan. This will require the cooperation of all social actors, without exception, to provide a long-term perspective on the resettlement of those who are returned to their country of origin. We believe that decision-making procedures will be more effective if they include the affected populations and if policies are specially designed to ensure co-ordination and effective response for those being repatriated. It is my hope that is report leads to the advancement of dialogue, knowledge and processes that are conducive to the universal values of justice, freedom and human dignity. Ultimately we would like to see positive actions to improve the quality of live for these populations and the Pacific communities in which they live. ___________________ Tracy Vienings CPR Unit Team Leader Guide Structure This report intends to provide policy makers, governments and civil society organizations with an easily accessible source of background information, approaches and assessments to work effectively with deported communities. It is not an exhaustive resource; rather one that provides a preliminary look at the issues of deportation and how they may be approached through engagement and service provision by civil society organizations or government departments. It is easy to read, accessible and flexible enough to be adapted to various circumstances and approaches amongst organizations aiming to engage and provide services to deported individuals. The report is divided into two parts; Part 1: Legislations Governing Criminal Deportation to the Pacific Islands from the United States, Australia and New Zealand which aims to help develop a clearer understanding about the processes that govern deportation to Pacific Islands Countries (PICs). Part 2: Working with Deportees in an Ethical Manner: Approaches for Engagement & Service Provision which aims to highlight ethical values, principles and standards to gain knowledge and better understand the situation for those people who are deported back to PICs. The report is designed for readers to go directly to sections that are of most relevant them; however it is advisable that all readers read the introductory section to gain a basic understanding of deportation issues in PICs. Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 2 Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 1 Introduction Deportation as described by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) refers to \u201cthe act of a State in the exercise of its sovereignty in removing an alien from its territory to a certain place after refusal of admission or termination of permission to remain.\u201d1 Therefore, for criminal deportation cases this refers to the removal of an alien (non-citizen) after committing a criminal act in the state. Currently, the three main countries deporting Pacific Islanders for criminal offences are Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America (USA).

According to the Return[ed] To Paradise \u2013 The Deportation Experience in Samoa & Tonga 2 report the average length of time deported individuals spent incarcerated was just over four years, with the majority serving less than two years in prison. The most common offences reported were common/aggravated assaults; equal second were aggravated robbery/ burglary and theft/robbery/burglary/; and third were drug related charges although violent and other serious offences were also reported. It was also reported that approximately 40 per cent of deported individuals that participated in the study had at some point reoffended with a small number having served prison time in-country. In terms of reintegration the report found that there were significant barriers, some of which are as follows: \u2022\ufffd Deported\ufffdindividuals\ufffdface\ufffdsignificant\ufffdsocial\ufffddislocation\ufffdon\ufffdarrival\ufffdas\ufffdthey\ufffdhave\ufffdtypically\ufffd spent most of their lives abroad; they suffer from family separation and are often not prepared to start a new life in an unfamiliar country. \u2022\ufffd Lack\ufffdconnectedness\ufffdwith\ufffdcommunity/village\ufffdand\ufffdculture;\ufffdlimited\ufffdconnections\ufffdwith\ufffdfamily\ufffd and poor local language skills make employment difficult; deported individuals generally relay on money remitted by relatives abroad. \u2022\ufffd Discrimination\ufffdand\ufffdxenophobia\ufffdcreate\ufffdfurther\ufffdbarriers\ufffdto\ufffdreintegration;\ufffdlocal\ufffdcommunities\ufffd may express shame, fear or rejection of the deported individuals. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffd dislocation\ufffd and\ufffd barriers\ufffd to\ufffd reintegration\ufffd may\ufffd give\ufffd rise\ufffd to\ufffd serious\ufffd mental\ufffd illness;\ufffd inability to deal with already existing disabilities and despair; completed suicide cases have been reported; recidivism has been reported due to lack of economic and social options. Supporting PICs to establish and enhance mechanisms that assist deported individuals through the period of reintegration will enable them to become responsible, participating members of the society, this is not only from a human rights perspective, but also from a security perspective. Ensuring that deported individuals have a wide range of choices and opportunities to facilitate their reintegration is a multidisciplinary and long-term approach that benefits both the community and the individual (re-)engaging with that community. Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 4 3 Pacific Approaches and Partnerships To address the needs of deported individuals various national, regional and international organizations have undertaken various initiatives. The most notable are those by the Samoan and Tongan Governments who alongside their civil society organizations (CSOs) have accomplished a number of significant achievements. The Tongan Government paved the way in 2008 with a high-level National Workshop on Deportees where the Outcome Statement supported activities that would assist the reintegration of deportees. The two CSOs that assisted with programmes were the Ironman Ministry Incorporated and the Foki ki \u2018Api Deportation Reconnection programme through the Tonga Lifeline Crisis Ministry of the Free Wesleyan Church. Similarly, the National Workshop on Deportees to Samoa held in 2010 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, Cultural Organization (UNESCO) accelerated initiatives by the Criminal Deportee Task Force that was led by the Attorney General and consisted of several government agencies3; representatives from a number of CSOs4; representatives of the deported community; UNESCO and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) who were invited to provide technical advice, support and act as observers. The Task Force developed a unique framework to coordinate law enforcement activities and with Cabinet endorsement, the Task Force created the Samoan Returnee Charitable Trust to provide reintegration services to deported individuals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f83deb70-a9df-42e0-97e3-b4e5bc68f7cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f83deb70-a9df-42e0-97e3-b4e5bc68f7cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11e050353e7dfabaaf1b2b1bdaefe768b07d445cfa90f53bc8939cb5b3154ed0"}, "2": {"node_id": "23987c51-0e80-4169-b1fb-54109e02b317", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23debbd48e57d594537a21be46b063bd6c73506fd005e7fa94f58f71bd84d553"}}, "hash": "f6627138394423ada4e3d13bae679aeae5551c5895c15e1f29a82b1591a6492b", "text": "At the regional level, organisations such as PIFS, the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police (PICP) and the Pacific Immigration Directors Conference (PIDC) have consulted with one another and undertaken various works, these include; The 2007/08, PIFS scoping study of deportees in Samoa, Tonga and the Cook Islands, which initially was concerned with managing the potential law enforcement threats posed by deportees, however it identified wider issues to be addressed such as a) the lack of national policies and coordination mechanisms between governments for managing criminal deportation; b) the stigmatisation of criminal deportees by communities; and c) the lack of resources/community services such as counselling and rehabilitation.

The works undertaken include; In 2009 UNESCO Office for the Pacific States started a research that culminated in 2011 with a publication titled Return[ed] to Paradise: The Deportation Experience in Samoa and Tonga. The baseline study which involved consultations with 56 deportees in Samoa and Tonga, examined the experiences and issues faced by deported individuals. The report findings included the average length of time incarcerated, types of offences, transportation and treatment at the border, reintegration and issues of marginalisation and discrimination. To follow on in 2010 two national consultations in Samoa and Tonga were conducted with deported individuals to identify specific programmes that may assist them in their reintegration. In both countries the top three programmatic areas where: 1) employment, 2) job training and educational courses, and 3) counselling/therapy. This information was then feed into the above mentioned National Workshop on Deportees to Samoa which lead national stakeholders to develop a plan to provide effective, detailed and comprehensive approaches to reintegration. In 2011, UNDP Pacific Centre and PIFS in response to FRSC outcomes published the Urban Youth in the Pacific: Increasing resilience and reducing risk for involvement in crime and violence report. The report looked at six countries: the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Tonga, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands. Whilst the report findings were extensive, the countries that highlighted the issue of deported individuals included: Samoa, Tonga, the Republic of Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The main recommendation of this report concluded that the provision of support for reintegration and resettlement services was necessary to effectively support deported individuals. Finally, in 2011 to advance and support the work undertaken to date in the region, UNDP Pacific Centre, PIFS with the support of UNESCO jointly convened an inaugural regional meeting on deportation at the PIFS Headquarters in Suva, Fiji. The event allowed key stakeholders from the region to share knowledge, coordinate efforts and resources to enhance national level capacity and develop guidelines for processing and assisting deported individuals. This regional meeting was attended by country representatives from Samoa, Tonga, Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) and Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 6 5 Part 1 Part One: Legislation Governing Criminal Deportations to the Pacific Islands from the United States, Australia and New Zealand Since 2006 various reports have highlighted the issues faced by Pacific Islanders who due to criminal offences are deported back to their country of citizenship. Many of those deported face significant barriers to reintegration7 contributing to what the Forum Secretariat\u2019s Regional Security Forum Committee (FRSC) states as concerns over the potential law enforcement threat.8 However, to date very limited resources have been allocated to understanding the legislations that govern deportation and even further yet to coordinating PICs government activities, particularly in the area of reintegration to reduce instances of recidivism. Objective This research paper aims to help develop a clearer understanding about the legislations that govern deportation to PICs from the United States of America (USA), Australia and New Zealand. Structure The scope for study and evaluation of national immigration laws and procedures is potentially vast. For clarity and ease of reference, this paper is therefore limited to and structured around six commonly-asked questions: 1) What is the legislation that governs deportation in the United States of America, Australia and New Zealand? 2) Which classes of non-citizens are potentially deportable? 3) What types of criminal activity make a non-citizen deportable? 4) What are the removal procedures for each of the countries? 5) What bilateral agreements and/or diplomatic memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with recipient States must be in place in order to deport? 6) What are the relevant human rights standards in the context of deportation?

Parts II and IV outline the grounds on which a non-citizen would be rendered inadmissible or deportable. Part IV outlines the removal proceedings. The Immigration and Nationality Act was significantly modified by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), both enacted in 1996. Instead of exclusion and deportation proceedings, IIRIRA introduced removal proceedings, during which an immigration judge will determine whether an alien is inadmissible or deportable, and thus subject to be removed from the United States. As one commentator has observed, \u201ctogether, the AEDPA and IIRIRA added more than fifty different crimes to the list of deportable offenses.\u201d 9 These amendments were generally applied with retrospective effect. This meant that individuals who had committed crimes prior to 1996 that were not then classified as \u201caggravated felonies\u201d fell within the scope of the new definition, and thus may be detained and placed into removal proceedings. 1.2 Australia The primary immigration statute in Australia is the Migration Act (1958). This is another large piece of legislation, which covers the breadth of immigration law from visa applications and procedures to detentions and removals. In Australia \u2018removal\u2019 is the term used to describe the departure of all non-citizens from Australia who do not hold a visa and, hence, are unlawful. This includes persons whose visas have been cancelled or refused under the Migration Act character requirements, set out in Section 501. The term \u2018deportation\u2019 on the other hand is concerned with persons who are leaving Australia subject to a deportation order under the Act. When a deportee leaves Australia, they are a lawful non-citizen who holds a visa. Their visa ceases when they leave Australia. Deportation powers are not used often in Australia. In most cases, persons who have committed a crime serious enough to warrant removal from Australia will have their visa cancelled under the Act and they will be removed from Australia as an unlawful non-citizen under section 198. 1.3 New Zealand Immigration law in New Zealand was consolidated by the Immigration Act, 2009. According to the government, this Act \u201cmodernises New Zealand\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d10 This is a comprehensive piece of immigration legislation, which outlines the law surrounding visas, residency, arrivals and departures, refugee status and a host of immigration issues. For the purposes of this paper, the most significant section is Part 6, which deals with deportation. This section covers the different types of circumstances that can make a person liable for deportation, including criminal conviction.11 It also outlines the rules regarding the deportation process. 2. Which classes of non-citizens are potentially deportable? 2.1 United States of America Throughout immigration law the term \u201calien\u201d is defined as \u201cany person not a citizen or national of the United States.\u201d 12 Generally, the rules regarding deportability apply equally to all non- citizens, whether they are in the country illegally, hold a temporary visa or a permanent resident card (informally known as a green card) or are present without authorization, and regardless of the length of time they have spent living in the USA. If a person is not a citizen or a national, then that person is an alien, and can therefore potentially be removed.13 2.2 Australia Australian law distinguishes between \u201clawful non-citizens\u201d and \u201cunlawful non-citizens\u201d. 14 Lawful non-citizens are persons in Australia who are not Australian citizens but have a valid visa, including permanent residents. Unlawful non-citizens are persons in Australia who are not Australian citizens whose visa has expired or has been cancelled. Lawful non-citizens become unlawful non-citizens if their visa is cancelled.15 One of the grounds for cancelling a visa is if the person has committed certain crimes.16 Unlawful non-citizens are liable to be deported; regardless of the number of years they have spent living in Australia before their visa was cancelled. 2.3 New Zealand Generally New Zealand law does not have a special term for persons who are not New Zealand citizens. The Immigration Act 2009 makes the distinction that whereas New Zealand citizens may freely enter the territory, all other persons must hold a visa to do so.17 Visas may be temporary or residence class.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ffc56c1-2acf-40a5-9a37-4041c9da57e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ffc56c1-2acf-40a5-9a37-4041c9da57e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5d50a9090b6ddcc425bc09f6d368090ad91c5d5f9b9393e570d90deced9bcc6"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ff10e9b-398e-4f24-ad18-2002b5a9b5ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15c3f9c483c47248236b4080506a0620e6ac3e0b2aa52c921c22189a67526b6d"}}, "hash": "f0eac3bbf10b86049a71dbc76621adddc28938ff8c9defda0a763ec219a86057", "text": "The same Act details all the ways in which a person holding a visa can become liable for deportation, such as a person\u2019s visa being granted in error or held under a false identity, or the person being convicted of a criminal offence.

Depending on the provision at issue, an alien may be rendered removable based upon a conviction or admission of having committed the criminal offense. The INA refers to broad categories of crimes, including: a) the violation of any state or federal law or regulation relating to a controlled substance; b) purchasing, selling, offering for sale, exchanging, using, owning, possessing, or carrying any weapon, part, or accessory which is a firearm or destructive device in violation of any law; c) aggravated felonies and d) crimes of moral turpitude. The latter two categories are broad and are further explored below. 3.1.ii Aggravated Felonies Originally the term \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 encompassed three things: murder, drug trafficking and the trafficking of offensive weapons.19 Over time however, the IIRIRA and AEDPA increased the number of offences in this category to encompass a wide range of other crimes. According to the U.S. Code,20 the term \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 presently encompasses more than fifty offences including murder, rape, sexual abuse of a child, drug trafficking, money laundering and certain theft offences (see Appendix A). The interplay of crimes which constitute grounds for deportation under state and federal criminal statutes is very complicated and can even vary in different judicial districts within the USA. For example, for some of the enumerated aggravated felonies, a state offense must be a felony for the aggravated felony definition to apply, but in other instances a misdemeanour can suffice. Questions on interpretation of INA provisions and specific state or federal convictions may warrant consultation with legal counsel. 3.1.iii Crimes of Moral Turpitude Crimes of moral turpitude are crimes that are deemed by the system to be inherently evil or depraved, or contrary to the accepted rules of morality or duties owed between persons. A non-citizen can be deported for the commission of a single crime of moral turpitude if that crime is committed within the first five years of admission and results in a sentence of 1 year or more. Non-citizens who have been legally admitted for more than five years can also be deported if they commit two or more crimes of moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. Moral turpitude is a term of art; there is no fixed list of moral turpitude crimes. Rather a crime will be deemed by the courts to involve moral turpitude if it contains certain elements, the most common of which are: fraud (knowingly making false representations), larceny (taking someone else\u2019s property without permission with the intent to keep it) or the intent to harm persons or things. Some examples of crimes that commonly do and do not constitute crime involving moral turpitude are outlined in Table 1.21 This table, which is designed to give one an idea of the types of crimes that could constitute crimes involving moral turpitude, is not exhaustive; also, it is important to bear in mind that the interpretation of \u2018crime involving moral turpitude\u2019 can vary within the USA due to jurisdictions. Distinctions below may not hold true for specific offenses. Table 1: Category of crimes that constitutes moral turpitude Category of Crime Examples of crimes which commonly do constitute moral turpitude Examples of crimes which typically do not constitute moral turpitude Crimes committed against property Arson, blackmail, burglary, embezzlement, extortion, forgery, robbery, theft, transporting and/or receiving stolen property with guilty knowledge (i.e. with the knowledge that the property is stolen) Accidental damage to private property, unknowingly passing bad checks, unknowingly possessing stolen property, juvenile delinquency Crimes committed against governmental authority Bribery, counterfeiting, mail fraud, perjury (e.g. where a witness is shown to have knowingly given false evidence in court), wilful tax evasion.

This process is explored in more detail in Section 4. To conclude, as confirmed by the first bullet point of the character test, the sentence length given during the initial trial is pivotal as to whether the person will be liable for deportation. In Australia the sentences attached to different crimes can vary greatly from each state or territory. As an example in South Australia all of the following crimes would make a person liable for deportation: murder (carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment), basic assault (up to two years), theft (up to ten years), passing valueless cheques (up to two years), basic criminal trespass (up to three years) and making a false report to a police officer (up to two years).28 Crimes committed against person, family relationship and sexual morality Abandonment of a minor child, assault (with intent to kill, rape, commit robbery, or commit serious bodily harm), assault with a dangerous or deadly weapon, bigamy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, incest, kidnapping, voluntary manslaughter (intentional killing where there was adequate provocation), involuntary manslaughter (reckless killing), mayhem, murder, pandering, prostitution and rape (rape includes statutory rape where the sexual intercourse is consensual but the victim is under the statutory age), gross indecency and lewdness (obscene sexual exposure or activity conducted in public) Assault without \u2018evil intent or depraved motive\u2019, illegitimacy (having children outside of marriage), libel, riot, attempted suicide As with aggravated felonies, attempting or assisting to commit a crime involving moral turpitude, is in itself a crime involving moral turpitude. As you can see from the Table 1, in some cases there is a fine line between those crimes that do and do not amount to moral turpitude. The distinction in these cases turns on whether the statute contains a specific intent element. If the statute provides for a crime where intent was fraudulent (i.e., deliberately making a false representation) or otherwise \u2018evil\u2019, the crime is likely to be one of moral turpitude. Furthermore, the classification of a crime as constituting moral turpitude changes over time with changes in public opinion. For example, until recent decades, homosexuality was treated as conduct amounting to a crime of moral turpitude.22 3.2 Australia 3.2.i The Migration Act Division 9 of the 1958 Migration Act sets out three main situations in which the Minister of Immigration (hereafter known as the Minister) may order the deportation of a non-citizen. The first is where the individual has been a resident in Australia for less than 10 years (total) and has committed a crime for which they have been sentenced to death, life imprisonment or a prison sentence of no less than 1 year.22 The second is where the individual is assessed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to be a threat to security.

The statistics on sentence length by type of crime are not readily available. Each crime carries its own maximum sentence length, but this is usually well above the normal sentence imposed. For example, \u201cthe offence of burglary carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment\u2026 [with] the average sentence being 10.9 months in 1995.\u201d30 Furthermore, life imprisonment is mandatory for murder and treason and is the maximum available sentence for manslaughter and Class A drug dealing. Meanwhile trespass can incur a prison sentence of three months.31 According to a census conducted by the New Zealand Department of Corrections the most common sentence length imposed on inmates is between one and two years.32 4. What are the removal procedures for each of the countries? 4.1 United States of America 4.1.i Detention and removal procedure The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has authority to arrest persons unlawfully present or subject to removal in the first instance. It is also authorized to lodge detainers on individuals arrested or incarcerated by other law enforcement agencies. Once lodged, the detainer requests that a law enforcement agency hold the individual for up to 48 hours beyond when the person would have otherwise been released. The DHS also issues a Notice to Appear (NTA) to the individual, which states the case against them. This should be issued within 72 hours of DHS detention. The NTA is divided into two parts. The first part, (\u201cAllegations\u201d) details the individual\u2019s name, country of origin, and the date and manner they entered the USA. It also gives the factual basis or reason for removal. The second part (\u201cCharges\u201d) lists the sections of the law under which the individual may be charged with removability. Not all removal proceedings are conducted before an immigration judge. Under INA Section 235 expedited removal proceedings may also be conducted by DHS personnel, although the Department of Justice (DOJ) may conduct further proceedings if DHS determines the individual has a credible fear of return to the designated country of removal. Furthermore, under INA Section 238, there are administrative removal proceedings for non-permanent resident aliens who have a conviction for an aggravated felony offense. The consideration of a removal decisions is generally a three-step process: First, the judge (or DHS official) will decide if the individual is removable (i.e., is the crime committed a deportable offence). Next, the judge will decide if there is any form of \u201crelief\u201d available to the individual. Finally, the judge will decide whether the individual meets the legal and discretionary standards to be given that form of relief. Most decisions made by an immigration judge are subject to administrative appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and judicial review before the courts of appeals. 4.1.ii Forms of relief and protection from removal33 - Cancellation of removal Aliens who have been found to be removable may apply for \u2018cancellation of removal\u2019 if they meet certain criteria. The cancellation of removal, as the name implies, cancels the removal order and allows the alien to (re)adjust their status to that of a permanent resident. For permanent resident aliens, the criteria that must be demonstrated are as follows: \u2022\ufffd The\ufffd individual\ufffd must\ufffd have\ufffd continuously\ufffd resided\ufffd in\ufffd the\ufffd USA\ufffd for\ufffd 7\ufffd years\ufffd after\ufffd being\ufffd admitted and before committing the offence that submitted them to removal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f98e3888-418c-430f-a866-bc4ec143dcee": {"__data__": {"id_": "f98e3888-418c-430f-a866-bc4ec143dcee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe535c922e4c4ae7bf1faeec534a85b6a3283fc718c72d6a2e231661ce6ea00c"}, "2": {"node_id": "39d32c3f-8e0a-459b-a47e-2e4d862c9bf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26abb84bf63ba389ac61c3f79f1fd7bd1b15d7e9137bdf137b1c4d3e3de8c45d"}}, "hash": "75882edc0ac9627d3c57a111aeb706908bcfe9766cb17c363c0697a11fe70f0f", "text": "\u2022\ufffd The\ufffdindividual\ufffdmust\ufffdhave\ufffdbeen\ufffda\ufffdlawful\ufffdpermanent\ufffdresident\ufffdfor\ufffd5\ufffdyears\ufffdor\ufffdmore. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdindividual\ufffdcannot\ufffdhave\ufffda\ufffdconviction\ufffdfor\ufffdan\ufffdaggravated\ufffdfelony. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdindividual\ufffdcannot\ufffdhave\ufffdpreviously\ufffdbeen\ufffdgranted\ufffdcancellation\ufffdof\ufffdremoval\ufffdor\ufffda\ufffdwaiver\ufffd under 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).34 If an individual establishes these criteria, it is then up to the judge to decide on balance whether to grant a cancellation of removal.

However the law in this area is complex and the criteria are such that the majority of individuals with criminal convictions would not be eligible. - Other forms of relief Other forms of relief or protection from removal to a particular country may be available if the individual can demonstrate that he/she is at risk of persecution or torture if he/she is returned. For example, an individual may be able to make a claim for asylum under the INA Section 208 if he/she is a refugee within the definition of INA Section 101(a) (42), because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. INA Section 241(b)(3) provides for \u2018withholding of removal\u2019 protection for individuals who face a clear probability of persecution in a particular country, but certain criminal acts and national security concerns can exclude an individual from such protection. Pursuant to U.S. treaty obligations, even certain criminal aliens who are not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal may be granted protection from removal to particular country if they can demonstrate that they would be tortured if removed there. The Secretary of Homeland Security may designate certain countries for \u2018Temporary Protected Status\u2019 (TPS), under which eligible aliens are allowed to live and work in the USA for a defined period of time not exciding 18 months; these periods can be extended by the President Secretary of Homeland Security. TPS is usually granted in response to a particular disaster, as an example Haiti has one in place until 2013, due to the earthquake. However TPS is not applicable to individuals whom have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanours therefore it is not available to most criminal aliens.36 Finally, under certain circumstances, a removable criminal alien may also be eligible for relief under the since-repealed section 212(c) of the INA, where the alien is a lawful permanent resident and has accrued seven years of relinquished domicile. 4.2 Australia 4.2.i Detention and removal procedure Under Australian Law, if a law enforcement officer reasonably suspects that a person is an unlawful citizen, they are obliged by law to detain that person.37 The removal procedure can commence whilst the individual is serving their prison sentence, or at the end of this sentence. There are technically two ways to being deported depending on whether the individual is removed under section 201 or 501 of the Migration Act (see 3.2.i). However, since section 501 is predominantly used now, this segment will focus on that procedure. As mentioned in Section 3.2.ii, if a person fails the character test set out in section 501, the Minister (or his/her delegate) then has the discretion to cancel their visa, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. The government gave guidance on this decision-making process in Ministerial Direction 41 (2009), which states that the Minister must consider the following: the protection of the Australian community from serious criminal or other harmful conduct, particularly crimes involving violence; whether the person was a minor when they began living in Australia; the length of time that the person has been ordinarily resident in Australia prior to engaging in criminal activity or other relevant conduct; and relevant international legal obligations. Specifically it states that: \u201cIn some circumstances it may be appropriate for the Australian community to accept more risk where the person concerned has, in effect, become part of the Australian community owing to their having spent their formative years, or a major portion of their life, in Australia.\u201d 38 4.2.ii Appeals The decision to cancel an individual\u2019s visa can be made by the Minister personally (usually reserved for national security cases) or by a delegate of the Minister, such as an officer of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC). If the Minister makes the decision personally, there is no appeal available.39 However if a delegate makes the decision, it can be appealed at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The individual has nine days40 from date of notification to seek review in this way. The AAT will hold a hearing, where they will examine all of the evidence presented by the individual and the Minister\u2019s delegate.

However, \u201cthe Minister still has a right to overrule an AAT decision if he/she thinks it is not in the public interest.\u201d 41 Once a final decision has been made by the Minister personally (rather than a delegate) there is no further right of appeal and the individual will be deported. Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 18 17 4.3 New Zealand 4.3.i Deportation procedure Under New Zealand law, the deportation process usually starts with the serving of a \u2018Deportation Liability Notice\u2019. This Notice details the grounds for deportation, whether there is a right of appeal and, if so, how to exercise it.42 If the person is not currently in prison when the Notice is served, they may be arrested and detained at that point.43 4.3.ii Appeals Whether a person can appeal against their deportation liability to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal depends on the type of visa they hold and the grounds for their liability of deportation. Permanent residents who are liable because they have been convicted of a criminal offence may appeal on humanitarian grounds only and must do so within 28 days of being served with the notice.44 An appeal on humanitarian grounds will be allowed where the Tribunal is satisfied that \u201cthere are exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature that would make it unjust or unduly harsh\u201d for the individual to be deported and where the Tribunal is satisfied that allowing the individual to remain in New Zealand would not be contrary to public interest.45 If the individual does not appeal, or if their appeal fails, the process ends with the serving of a \u2018Deportation Notice\u2019, which informs the individual that they are to be deported, that their visa has been cancelled and the consequences of attempting to return.46 5. What bilateral agreements and/or diplomatic Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with recipient States must be in place in order to deport? It is a generally accepted principle that nation states must accept the return of their nationals who have been ordered expelled from another country. Bilateral agreements exist between States to govern the practical details of the deportation process such as the documents that must be included with a repatriation request and the timeframe and method for communicating a decision. The absence of such agreements can in some cases result in prolonged detention. 5.1 United States of America The USA does have written agreements with some nation states governing repatriation, but such agreements are not required by most nations for acceptance of their recognized nationals. Under individual agreement with many sovereign nations, foreign nationals ordered removed from the USA, by competent authority, may be removed without a formal written repatriation agreement. 5.2 Australia Removals are conducted under the provisions of the Migration Act. There is no mandatory requirement to have in place a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Australia has, however, signed MoU\u2019s with a number of receiving countries in order to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of removals. Australia has not signed MoU\u2019s with any Pacific countries to date. 5.3 New Zealand New Zealand does not have any formal bilateral agreements or MOU\u2019s with other countries pertaining to deportation. New Zealand will only deport persons to countries where the person has an unfettered right of entry according to the validity of their travel document (generally their country of nationality or citizenship). When deporting criminal offenders to PICs New Zealand provides advance notice of those deportations via the Interpol mechanism. New Zealand observes relevant UN Advisories in respect to non-returnable countries. 6. What are the relevant human rights standards in the context of deportation? Human rights are applicable to all persons on a state\u2019s territory irrespective of a person\u2019s nationality or statelessness. States are required to respect, protect, and fulfil the human rights of citizens and non-citizens. Therefore, the rights set forth in the core human rights treaties47 to which a state is a party to, equally apply to non-citizens on a state\u2019s territory. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Prevention of Discrimination and the Rights of Non-Citizens concluded that all persons should by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ba25f25-08f4-4e8c-918d-aad51c4c4488": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ba25f25-08f4-4e8c-918d-aad51c4c4488", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff5e1992a39e4de8e910f17340b77f5576ec73a23f34bf08aff9f6f51f1009b4"}}, "hash": "ff5e1992a39e4de8e910f17340b77f5576ec73a23f34bf08aff9f6f51f1009b4", "text": "virtue of their essential humanity enjoy all human rights.

Nevertheless, governments have the duty to make sure they exercise their immigration power in a way that does not violate the fundamental human rights of non-citizens. When making the decision to deport an individual, states are bound by international law to consider the individual\u2019s human rights and the consequences of deportation thereon. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, an independent body of experts mandated to oversee state compliance and implementation of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has issued the following authoritative guidance: \u201cIt is in principle a matter for the State to decide who it will admit to its territory. However, in certain circumstances an alien may enjoy the protection of the Covenant even in relation to entry or residence, for example, when considerations of non-discrimination, prohibition of inhuman treatment and respect of family life arises.\u201d 50 The Doctrine of non-refoulement The principle of non-refoulement in international law forbids states to deport persons to a place where he/she faces persecution or torture. The protection from refoulement for persons who face persecution can only be derogated in certain limited circumstances. The protection from refoulement for persons who face torture is absolute. The principle is codified in both human rights and refugee law. The Refugee Convention prohibits the return of refugees to places where their life or freedom would be threatened on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.51 Under human rights law, states must refrain from exposing any individual \u201cto the danger of torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by way of their extradition, expulsion, or refoulement.\u201d52 The UN Human Rights Committee provides authoritative guidance on this provision. It argued that the prohibition of non-refoulement extends to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as punishment for a crime or as an educative or disciplinary measure. The Committee further notes that prolonged solitary confinement may also amount to a prohibited act. Consequently, states must not deport nationals to countries where they face such treatment.53 Right to family life and rights of the child A person\u2019s right to family life, privacy and protection from arbitrary interference is codified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.54 The right to family unity and to family life applies to the context of deportation as it imposes, in some instances, limits on states\u2019 powers to deport. The Human Rights Committee for example noted that even though it remains a matter for the state to decide who it will admit to its territory, with regards to considerations of family life, an alien may enjoy the protection of his/her rights in relation to residence or entry to a country.55 The UN Human Rights Committee found in Madafferi v. Australia that the deportation of an Italian national due to criminal convictions would violate his rights to privacy, family and home, because he was married to an Australian national and had four Australian children.56 Similarly, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found in Wayne Smith, Hugo Armendariz, et al. v. United States that the USA acted in violation of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man\u2019s provisions with regards to private, family life and protection for children because it failed, inter alia, to provide for an individualized balancing test to weigh the state\u2019s interest in preserving the general welfare, against the fundamental rights of non-citizens.57 Similar guidance comes from the European Court of Human Rights, which held that states must \u2013 among other", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8304b08-935d-4e50-8cff-581217daadc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8304b08-935d-4e50-8cff-581217daadc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "830b71835e71fe746e3206dbd6c37a08a367d4355dae9b202b1e4876024634d0"}}, "hash": "830b71835e71fe746e3206dbd6c37a08a367d4355dae9b202b1e4876024634d0", "text": "factors \u2013 consider the severity of offence and danger emanating from a person in deportation decisions and must also take due account of spousal relationship and existence of children.58 6.2 Human rights obligations and receiving PICs The duty to uphold the rights of individuals who have been deported/removed for criminal offences applies not only to states that deport/remove but also to those that admit individuals upon return. Therefore, PICs are obliged as signatories to standards and/or conventions that pertain to human rights to ensure that individuals who have been deported/removed for criminal offences, as citizens of their countries, have their fundamental freedom and rights recognised and protected. 6.3 Detainment of deported individuals upon return The Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.59 The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in addition regulates that no one shall be deprived of liberty except on grounds and in accordance to Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 22 21 established law. Furthermore, any person detained shall be informed at the time of arrest about the reason for the arrest and be promptly informed of any charges.60 With this in mind, PICs that admit individuals who have been deported/removed for criminal offences need to consider served sentences for the convictions and recognise that upon admission to their country of citizenship individuals are generally not suspected of or charged with any crime. The Covenant also regulates that a person shall have the liberty of movement within his or her country and the freedom to choose his or her residence. States cannot restrict these rights except if it is provided for by existing law and necessary to protect national security, public order, health, morals, or the rights and freedoms of others. This is of course as long as they are consistent with the other rights recognized by the Covenant.61 6.4 Collection of DNA, fingerprints and other personal information upon return With regards to the collection and storing of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), fingerprints and other personal information of individuals who have been deported/removed for criminal offences, states admitting their nationals need to strike a balance between the privacy rights of the individual (given that these samples contain sensitive information such as health and genetic relationships) whilst recognizing the interests of society at large to combat criminality.62 Guidance with regards to the collection and retention of DNA or fingerprints and an individual\u2019s right to privacy comes from the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations Human Rights Committee. A case considered by the European Court of Human Rights dealt with the retention of DNA and other personal information of individuals who were suspects but were never convicted of a crime and whose records of DNA and other information were indefinitely kept. In their case, the Court ruled that the indefinite retention of these profiles was a breach of their privacy rights. The Court did not specifically consider the legitimacy of retaining DNA and other information of criminal convicts, which is common practice. The Court did note, however, that it was essential to have clear and detailed rules, as well as safeguards, that govern the scope and application of DNA, fingerprints, and cellular sample collection and retention by States including to prevent use of such data in a manner that is inconsistent with an individual\u2019s right to privacy. Also, the Court held that the collection and retention of fingerprint and DNA information pursues a legitimate purpose, namely the detection, and therefore, prevention of crime.63 Similarly, on databases and other information management systems the United Nations Human Rights Committee holds that: \u201cThe gathering and holding of personal information on computers, data banks and other devices, whether by public authorities or private individuals or bodies, must be regulated by law. Effective measures have to be taken by States to ensure that information concerning a person\u2019s private life does not reach the hands of persons who are not authorized by law to receive, process and use it, and is never used for purposes incompatible with the Covenant. In order to have the most effective protection of his private life, every individual should have the right to ascertain in an intelligible form, whether, and if so, what personal data is stored in automatic data files, and for what purposes.\u201d64 Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 24 23 Overview and Comparisons a) Potential deportability of non-citizens We", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f0b0d19-7cdb-40ff-bc33-02cdf7ca3075": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f0b0d19-7cdb-40ff-bc33-02cdf7ca3075", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2b2798acae91e047b71531056bae4625ba125c78869dd77e9c461ff139661db"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddcbef40-2ba1-4ef5-9662-a34b060fd1a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-deported-individuals-pacific-legal-and-ethical-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de90b5ccaaf9996281cdf46cb6b9774b054de122b16e5cffa447d58c065f6340"}}, "hash": "a89c066e4d9a3c5543a5199ff6b614abcf48d87c83aa780c3a2bd9394391ae35", "text": "have seen that, in each of the three studied countries, all adult non-citizens are potentially deportable if they commit certain crimes. This is true irrespective of their length of stay and the personal and professional ties they have made within those countries, although these factors may be taken into account when assessing the merits of an individual case. b) Breadth of offences for which a person can be deported We have seen that, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, liability for deportation depends very much on the length of sentence given at the original trial. It is therefore difficult to get a complete picture of the range of offences for which a person can be deported without a statistical breakdown of the length of sentence typically awarded for different types of crime. That being said, we have seen that in the USA crimes which can make an individual deportable range from murder, rape and incest to mail fraud and wilful tax evasion. Meanwhile in Australia and New Zealand crimes such as trespass, passing valueless cheques and making false reports to the police can potentially attract a long enough prison sentence to make the accused liable for deportation. Given the importance of the type of criminal offense and length of sentence in determining an individual\u2019s deportability, the legal advice that he or she receives from his or her criminal defence attorney during a domestic criminal prosecution can be very important. For example, in the USA it may be possible to avoid deportation for some crimes that might otherwise amount to aggravated felonies by submitting a guilty plea under a different criminal statutory provision or pleading guilty on the condition of receiving a sentence of less than one year, either of which in certain circumstances could avoid immigration consequences.65 Of course, each case is unique and non-citizens should consult with experienced immigration attorneys to understand how a criminal plea may affect their U.S. immigration status. Similarly in Australia and New Zealand it may be possible to secure a sentence that just falls beneath the required length for deportability. Owing to this huge potential impact on immigration status, the United States Supreme Court has recently held that defence attorneys must inform their clients when a guilty plea carries a risk of deportation.66 c) Procedure The procedure for deportation, although not identical in each state, is similar, in that in most cases \u2013 the individual is detained and issued with a notice of deportation and he/she then has a limited amount of time to contest the notice before being deported. Deportation is largely dominated by a mass of black letter law \u2013 defining crimes, outlining procedures, detailing transportation etc. However, across all three states there is a point at which individual discretion comes into play in many cases \u2013 in the USA, it is DHS\u2019s decision whether to initiate removal proceedings or the immigration judge\u2019s decision in removal proceedings whether to grant cancellation of removal and/or some other discretionary relief from removal; in Australia, it could be the Minister considering the advice of the AAT; and in New Zealand, it could be the Tribunal considering an appeal on humanitarian grounds. In many cases there is an opportunity for the non-citizen to present the reasons why they should not be deported \u2013 their social and emotional ties to the state, their human rights that may be violated by deportation etc. For this reason, just as adequate legal representation was essential during their initial trial, it is perhaps even more so at the deportation stage.

The values which inform the principles assist in the formulation of standards. This ensures that highly sensitive situations and information do not result in further social, physical and/or psychological harm. The provision of ethically responsible engagement and service provision ensures the respect and dignity due to deported individuals as well as any other resident of the country. It ensures a benefit to the whole community and encourages responsibility, professionalism and a commitment to good practice. Scope The following approach sets forth values, ethical principles and standards by which engagement and service provision to deported individuals can be progressed and evaluated. Whilst they are interrelated and complementary they aim to promote the responsiveness and ethical reflection of all stakeholders, these may include: \u2022\ufffd Members\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffddeported\ufffdcommunity; \u2022\ufffd Members\ufffdof\ufffdgovernment\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Members\ufffdof\ufffdcivil\ufffdsociety\ufffdorganizations; \u2022\ufffd Institutions\ufffdundertaking\ufffdresearch\ufffdand\ufffdresearchers; \u2022\ufffd Service\ufffdproviders; \u2022\ufffd Funding\ufffdagencies; \u2022\ufffd International\ufffdorganisations. The value of this approach means that it highlights the complexity and diversity of the current working environment. It can complement existing professional standards and be flexible enough to take into account cultural sensitivities and their implications for meaningful engagement and service provision to deported individuals. It may also be used as a reference to consider protocols and policies within institutions and therefore act as a tool to address issues, questions and other concerns prior to the commencement of service delivery. Finally, this approach facilitates attention to and reflection of ethical standards that are required prior to engagement and/or service provision to deported individuals. Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 30 29 IN FOCUS 1: What do we mean by ethics?

Ethical Approaches for Engagement & Service Provision Respect The value of respect involves the acknowledgement and regard for a person, family, groups and/or community\u2019s beliefs, customs, culture, welfare and views. The regard for this is fundamental to empowering people, enhancing their wellbeing, capacity, opportunities and in turn reinforcing each person\u2019s intrinsic value and their dignity.68 When working with deported individuals it is about respectful engagement. This recognises the fact that all human beings are unique and have value; this value informs the way in which interaction occurs between people; engagement. Recognising the importance of human autonomy provides an understanding that there must be an empowerment aspect to the engagement. Respectful engagement often means creating the ability that allows an individual his/her own decision-making process regarding what might be best for them in their life. In some cases, this value may involve protection for those individuals with limited autonomy. IN FOCUS 2: Disability & Deportation Despite ongoing attempts by disability-rights advocates, the deportation of people with psychiatric and physical disabilities to PICs continues. The vulnerabilities and barriers experienced by those with disabilities arriving in-country can be made worse due to: limited familial-links, lack of support, limited employment opportunities, limited access to health care or medication, inappropriate accommodation arrangements and a lack of transportation. Community service providers aiming to assist deported individuals with disabilities require a range of skills that is not limited to an anti- discrimination approach. This can include a social integration approach that allows people to participate in their own resettlement plans and are allowed to advocate for their own rights against the barriers they see in their communities.

Social justice seeks to promote social change when discrimination, marginalisation, oppression and other forms of injustice are present. The result of social justice activities improves access to resources, services and knowledge. It fosters equal opportunities and meaningful engagement in decision-making forums, especially for those most affected by social injustices. This in turn promotes the enhancement of capacity that then leads to social change.69 IN FOCUS 3: Women & Deportation The position of women who have been deported back to PICs has been identified as a priority area due to the increased risk of sexual and gender based violence, sexual and labor exploitation (particularly in unprotected informal sectors such as domestic work), limited access to land and/or other income generation activities. This means that women, who have limited familial links in-country, limited training and/or employment skills, have substance use issues and limited access to health services in particular reproductive health, become a particularly vulnerable population. Service providers aiming to assist women who have been deported require the integration of a gender perspective to analyze the position of women in the context of deportation in-country and develop strategies, policies and programs that counter exploitation, discrimination and violence. Integrity Integrity sustains and upholds the consistency of values, ethical standards and principles that are integral to enhancing human wellbeing. Integrity defines a person\u2019s actions through honest, truthful and responsible behaviours. It promotes responsibility for enhancing the human rights and self-determination of marginalised populations including deportees. Acting with integrity ensures the rights of those whose autonomy has been diminished, is safeguarded and protected. Integrity involves remaining attentive to and avoiding real or potential conflict of interest. Conflict of interest arises when any professional relationship is used to gain or exploit another to further business, personal, political and/or religious interests.70 Working with integrity aims to expose unethical conducts and maintain adequate measures in order to prevent future misconduct. Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 32 31 Working with integrity means the constant monitoring and evaluation of policies, programs and practises in the field. It includes contributing to developing knowledge, continuing with education, and development to assist in identifying emerging needs. Integrity also safeguards against incompetency which might be initially seen as corrupt behaviours. IN FOCUS 4: Information Management Information gathering concerning deported individuals needs to be carefully assessed against any risks and/or benefits. Whilst many law enforcement agencies are obliged to gather information from and about deported individuals, this must be done with due respect to fundamental ethical values and legislations regarding human rights (refer to Legislation Governing Deportation Section 6.2). Other government and civil society institutions need to weigh the importance of such activity against the respect to privacy, autonomy and freedom.71 If absolutely necessary, information gathering needs to demonstrate the most minimal risk to deported individuals and should build on experience and good practise. Records and documents need to be accurate and demonstrate services provided. They should remain confidential and must only include information directly relevant to the service provided. Records and information relating to the service users need to be accessible to them.72 The provision of information or access to personal records to third parties and/or other service users should not be permitted unless directed by a service user and/or by their legal guardian. Informed Consent Once the risks and benefits are determined and understood, voluntary informed consent should be acquired. The use of clear and understandable documents and/or language should outline the purpose, risks and limitations of service provision. It should also outline a person\u2019s right to refuse and/or withdraw from the service(s) and have input to the time frame covered by the consent. Adequate measures need to be put in place to ensure the comprehension of and protection of deported individuals who may not be fully autonomous. This should include seeking the permission of legal guardians and or caregivers.73 Attaining informed consent from deported individuals may be a challenge due to assumed or real suspicions, fear and/or previous negative experiences. Building rapport and basic trust is essential and a foundation block to enabling best outcomes for deported individuals. IN FOCUS 5: Unlawful Activity During the course of work, instances of deportees undertaking unlawful activities may be exposed. This can be both current notifiable activities and/or planned future unlawful activities. It is recommended that clear standards are established that dictate what staff/volunteers and organisations are obliged to disclose, the legal implications and the vulnerabilities that may exist.

Risk & Benefits The engagement of and service provision to deported individuals requires a justifiable benefit and the adequate assessment of risk for everyone involved. It ensures that the respect for all stakeholders is not compromised, the benefits reach beneficiaries and any risks are minimised through identification, gauging the probability/severity of negative impact and its management.74 The highest priority should be the risk and benefit to deported individuals. The benefit of any undertaking must justify any potential harm, discomfort and/or inconvenience to deported individuals. This is done by identifying risks, gauging the probability and/or severity of these risks, assessing how they can be minimised and/or determining its justification against potential benefits, and finally, understanding how and if these risks can be managed.75 A clear example of risk and benefit in relation to deported individuals is around the prevention of re-traumatisation. Many circumstances may call for deported individuals to reveal personal information; this may be in relation to their deportation, incarceration, family life and so forth. Some of these experiences may be painful, humiliating and may cause extreme levels of stress, anxiety and/or other psychological conditions. It is for this reason that situations that may cause re-traumatisation should be minimised and be done only for specific purposes that are beneficial to deported individuals.76 Considering the risk and benefits to staff/volunteers engaged to work with deported individuals should also be a priority. Staff/volunteers need to be screened carefully, made aware of the sensitivities around the work and be fully prepared to engage with complex issues. When considering who may be selected to work with deported individuals, local staff/volunteers should be made aware of possible stigmatisation and/or moral codes with which they can be branded due to their work. Further, when selecting staff/volunteers to work with deported individuals\u2019 consideration should be given to the life experience of candidates, including the Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues Working with Deported Individuals in the Pacific: Legal and Ethical Issues 34 33 languages they speak and cultural background and/or other cultures they have interacted with positively.77 Finally, considerations about physical safety and psychological trauma that may be experienced due to the work should be considered and minimised through adequate supervision. Organisations engaging with vulnerable populations and especially providing services to deported individuals need to consider how information that is made available to them via programs and/or research might be utilised and stored (for further information see In Focus Box 4). Information must be stored away in a secure place where minimal numbers of people have access. Service providers must ensure information that is required to be shared with third parties is done so in a safe and ethical manner. This process ensures that the risks and benefits associated with the storage and provision of information assist in developing better outcomes for deportees and assist with better coordination between organisations. It ensures that information will not be misinterpreted or cause further prejudices and/or stereotypes against deported individuals. All information attained needs to lead back to adequate advocacy and be reported back to deported individuals. Finally, organizations engaged in service provision need to carefully consider the possible risk to the wider community. This may be in relation to certain activities that are done with deported individuals but may be attended by or expose other potentially vulnerable populations, such as children or at-risk young people. Or it may be in relation to reoffending behaviours that may be encouraged by other deported individuals during activities that are intended for supporting their reintegration. IN FOCUS 6: Practical Tool: Increasing Competencies through Capacity Assessment The capacity assessment tool (see Appendix 3) is very practical for organisations that aim to work with deported individuals and other marginalised or vulnerable populations. It assists in furthering organizations effectiveness, performance and independence ensuring sustainable benefits for beneficiaries and the community at large. It outlines an accessible, flexible and systematic approach for identifying capacity needs, planning technical support and monitoring and evaluating the effect of capacity development. It can also be used as an advocacy tool for increasing funding in capacity development of service providers. Concluding Remarks As demonstrated ethical values, principles and standards increases knowledge and encourages responsibility, professionalism and a commitment to good practice. It sets forth an approach by which engagement and service provision to deported individuals can be progressed and evaluated.

It is by no means an exhaustive list; however it offers service providers with a basic list to begin discussions (see Recommended Resources). \u2022 Advocacy and Communication Capacity This capacity area looks at the organizations ability to effectively create, sustain and promote networking and partnerships with other organizations, government and/or donor agencies so as to respond relevantly to beneficiaries and the current operating environment. \u2022 Programming and Technical Capacity This capacity area looks at various forms of programming and technical capacities that organizations may and may not provide. Generally, when responding to the needs of deported individuals it would be advised that an exhaustive social service needs assessments is conducted to determine appropriate programming and adequate technical capacities required. This may be done in various forms (see Recommended Resources) however, this tool provides an initial basic and easy model.

The current negotiation emerging from the Doha Ministerial Declaration of 2001 is expected to address economic and human development concerns, with an agenda of negotiation covering a wide range of subjects. The suspension of the current WTO negotiations on 24 July 2006 can be attributed to some of the structural and operational problems of the WTO and the complexities of the issues as well as the diversities in the interests of the countries. The Handbook explains, in simple language and layout, the general principles and processes of the WTO. It was initially prepared by UNDP for training of South Asian economic journalists in December 2005. The author elaborates on the signi\ufb01cant decisions that have been made in previous negotiations in relation to issues covered in the current negotiations launched by the Doha Ministerial Declaration in 2001. As the suspension of the negotiations shows, the asymmetrical negotiating power of developed countries prevails. Apart from pursuing their aims in the WTO negotiations, they are also likely to intensify their efforts in bilateral and regional free trade", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94878294-09ef-4ba0-aede-a2af29524813": {"__data__": {"id_": "94878294-09ef-4ba0-aede-a2af29524813", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f02b9c43f0edbaf97f8171b45f3c8e33322ed8b74611711672b135d122bdff57"}}, "hash": "f02b9c43f0edbaf97f8171b45f3c8e33322ed8b74611711672b135d122bdff57", "text": "agreements (BTAs/ RTAs), such as on intellectual property rights, services, investment, competition and the environment. These issues have particular human development implications for developing countries. Often the BTAs/RTAs have requirements that are \u201cWTO-plus,\u201d or rights and obligations that go beyond what is required in the multilateral forum. This emerging trend, to negotiate international trade outside the multilateral framework, makes it clear that developing countries must build awareness about the commitments and safeguard their development interests. - 5 - 1. BOUQUETS AND BRICKBATS Advantages from the GATT/WTO system Why are developing countries in the WTO, and why is there such a rush to join it? Some important reasons are the following: First, developing countries need to export because (i) they need foreign exchange to pay for their essential imports, like fuel, technology, capital goods, industrial inputs and food, and (ii) they need markets in other countries for their goods and services to expand their production, employment and pro\ufb01t. However, their goods and services cannot automatically enter other countries; there has to be permission for entry. This permission, in turn, requires an agreement with other countries. Thus, to send exports to other countries a developing country will need to have bilateral agreements with all of them. Joining a multilateral framework, such as the WTO, where Member Countries have allowed the import and export of goods and services among themselves, obviates this procedure. It is also unlikely that a developing country will get a better deal in a bilateral agreement than what is possible in the multilateral framework. Recent experiences show that they have had to make a higher level of commitments in BTAs with developed countries than what is required in the WTO. Second, the mechanism for the enforcement of rights and obligations in the WTO, embodied in its dispute settlement system, provides some protection against the subjective actions of other countries. Yet the enforcement mechanism has many de\ufb01ciencies, as will be explained in following sections. Third, being a Member of the WTO community of countries gives a country the opportunity to learn from others\u2019 experiences and to in\ufb02uence the trade negotiating process, to some extent. Finally, because the GATT/WTO framework for conducting international trade has existed for nearly six decades, it is out of the ordinary for a country to remain outside it, and other countries may view this exclusion suspiciously. Problems in the GATT/WTO system Why are developing countries persistently complaining about this system? The basic problems are both structural and operational. Some important ones are explained below. Structural problems First, the framework has the basic objective to liberalize trade in goods and services and to protect intellectual property rights, to be explained in a later section. The former results in the expansion of exports and directly bene\ufb01ts countries with supply capacity. The latter gives monopoly privileges, including high \ufb01nancial returns, to the owners of intellectual property rights (IPR), thus bene\ufb01ting the countries that own intellectual property. Most developing countries have neither a good supply base for goods and services, nor own much intellectual property. As a result, their direct gains are comparatively smaller than those of developed countries. Second, the basis for liberalization is reciprocity. If a country is able to give more, it gets more. Conversely, if it gives less, it also gets less. Such a system is appropriate for countries at a similar level of economic development. Problems arise when Members - 6 - have vastly diverse economic levels. In such a situation, there is built-in bias in a system that increases disparities among countries. Some correctives have been attempted from time to time, such as differential and more favourable treatment of developing countries, but none of these initiatives have worked satisfactorily. Third, the ultimate weapon for enforcing Members\u2019 rights is through retaliation, as will be explained in the chapter on Enforcement Mechanism. This enforcement may be most appropriate in a system where Members have similar strength. In the GATT/WTO system it puts developing countries that are the weaker partners at a further disadvantage. For them, retaliation against a major developed country has both economic and political costs. Therefore, their capacity to enforce their rights and obligations is constrained. Finally, certain basic principles and provisions in this system operate against development efforts, at least in the short term. For example, a basic principle in the GATT is national treatment, i.e., non-discrimination between an imported product and a similar domestic product, to be explained in detail later in the chapter on Trade in Goods. In the process of development, a country may prefer to encourage the production and use of a domestic product, but it is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c8029f4-abc1-471a-b43c-dfb9b2c101b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c8029f4-abc1-471a-b43c-dfb9b2c101b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69901bdb0c816c020ffba5dae6563a4ca9dbaacd236a56c26009b1a9271fa3ff"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbaff089-1eef-4684-88e1-2f4d5f94f5b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "637c2c14e191b54451e67ad25a1bd0bda88edc4f3d287eb7e7d64a56f5b9b84f"}}, "hash": "4aeef5759882eaa749a0181f0b358349785043171e112ffdf878294e94707df9", "text": "prohibited through the principle of national treatment. Operational problems First, the decision-making process in the WTO system is dominated by developed countries, as explained in detail in the chapter on the WTO Process. Their objectives are clear and strategies focused. They have technical and \ufb01nancial resources to prepare well, in order to put forth their points of view strongly and effectively in the negotiations; often they become the driving force in the negotiations. Thus, the subjects of their economic and political interest come to centre stage, resulting in decisions aligned with their agendas. These norms often cause frustration among developing countries. Substantial negotiations often are conducted in small groups where most developing countries are not present, which will be explained later in the chapter on the WTO Process. Then the results are brought to the larger group -- and Members that have not participated are expected to agree. Developing countries, even though they may not be in full agreement, \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to stop the decision at that stage because such a move will cast them as obstructionists, with political costs. Hence, developing countries generally keep quiet, but the imbalanced negotiating process continues, adding to their burden of obligations and increasing their dissatisfaction. Sometimes there are loopholes in WTO agreements, which developed countries often use to their advantage. For example, the major developed countries ful\ufb01lled their obligation of reducing their domestic subsidy in strict technical sense, but, in actual practice, they increased the total quantum of their domestic subsidy. This has been possible because the Agreement on Agriculture (AOA) stipulates that some subsidies are immune from reduction. Moreover, in the textiles and clothing (T&C) sector, developed countries ful\ufb01lled their obligation of liberalization, but, in effect, only very partial liberalization occurred for nearly 10 years under the implementation of Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). The ATC left the choice of products to the importing countries; developed countries that were importers and had been imposing restraints chose only such products for liberalization that were not under import restraint. They ful\ufb01lled their obligation without signi\ufb01cantly liberalizing their textile imports until the end of 2004, when all restraints were automatically abolished \u2013 making the ATC an \u201cend-loaded\u201d process. - 7 - Finally, in general, developing countries believe that the GATT/WTO process is about extracting concessions from them, and that it constrains their development space and options. Naturally, it generates tension in the system. - 8 - 2. STRUCTURE AND COVERAGE OF THE WTO Structure Originally, the WTO was formulated as the GATT in 1947. The United States and the United Kingdom were the main architects, though there were 23 members in the beginning, of which 12 were those that are now called developing countries. The GATT was essentially a framework for reducing tariffs (or customs duty) until 1979. At this time, certain disciplines were ampli\ufb01ed in the non- tariff areas, such as subsidies given by governments, dumping by \ufb01rms, licensing in the case of import control, and valuation of customs duty at the time of import of a product. As a result of the Uruguay Round of negotiations (1986-94), the WTO was created on 1 January 1995 and the GATT became part of it. The WTO is a multilateral framework (an agreement among governments) for the conduct of international trade in goods and services and also for the protection of intellectual property rights, such as patents, copyrights and trademarks. The WTO has a set of multilateral agreements, primarily on the rights and obligations of governments that prescribe disciplines in the formulation of rules, procedures and practices in these areas. In a limited way, it also provides disciplines on \ufb01rms, for example, by restraining them from exporting products at abnormally low prices (considered dumping). But it is only governments that participate in the negotiations, in the formulation of agreements, and in raising disputes against one another regarding the enforcement of provisions of the agreements. Coverage The WTO disciplines are in three parts: (i) for trade in goods, contained in the GATT, and in some other agreements on goods (ii) for trade in services, contained in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); and (iii) for protection of intellectual property rights, contained in the Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Agreement on TRIPS).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbaff089-1eef-4684-88e1-2f4d5f94f5b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbaff089-1eef-4684-88e1-2f4d5f94f5b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69901bdb0c816c020ffba5dae6563a4ca9dbaacd236a56c26009b1a9271fa3ff"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c8029f4-abc1-471a-b43c-dfb9b2c101b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4aeef5759882eaa749a0181f0b358349785043171e112ffdf878294e94707df9"}}, "hash": "637c2c14e191b54451e67ad25a1bd0bda88edc4f3d287eb7e7d64a56f5b9b84f", "text": "There is an agreement called the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) for the enforcement of the rights and obligations and for resolving disputes between governments in the areas covered by these agreements.

So far, these conferences have been held in Singapore (1996), Geneva (1998), Seattle (1999), Doha (2001), Cancun (2003) and Hong Kong (2005). In the period between two Ministerial Conferences, the General Council is empowered to discharge the functions of the Ministerial Conference. There are councils for speci\ufb01c areas: Council for Trade in Goods, for the implementation of agreements on goods; Council for Trade in Services, for implementation of the GATS; and Council for TRIPS, for implementation of the Agreement on TRIPS. The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) operates the DSU. All Members of the WTO are members of all these bodies. Decision-making process Decisions are generally taken in the WTO by consensus, which has been speci\ufb01cally de\ufb01ned. A decision will be deemed as to be based on consensus \u201cif no Member, present at the meeting when the decision is being taken, formally objects to the proposed decision.\u201d If consensus is not possible, the decision is taken by voting. There is a system of \u2018one Member, one vote\u2019 and decisions are made generally by majority vote. For very special purposes, higher majority is prescribed. For example, a decision on the interpretation of an agreement or on waivers of an obligation needs a three-fourths majority. Amendments require two-thirds majority, or in some matters, acceptance by all Members. In actual practice, Members seldom resort to voting; differences are settled by prolonged consultations and discussions. - 10 - 3. TRADE IN GOODS Basic principles The most basic principle in the GATT/WTO system is that there should be free and open competition in trade. Toward this end, two provisions form the main pillars of the system: most favoured nation treatment and national treatment, as explained below. Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment This provides that there must not be any discrimination between different Member countries in the manner of treatment that a Member extends to them. (The title is derived from the fact that any concession given by a country to the most favoured country also has to be extended to all members of the WTO). There are two examples: \ufffd If a country wants to give lower tariffs on a product to another country as a reward for receiving aid or investment, it will be violating the MFN principle. \ufffd A country cannot express displeasure to another country for voting against it in the UN by stopping imports from that country or by introducing an especially cumbersome custom clearance process for goods from that country. All tariffs and import rules have to be non-discriminatory between various countries that are Members of the WTO. There are some exceptions to the MFN rule. For example, two countries or a group of countries may form regional trading arrangements and may extend lower tariffs to one another without giving this bene\ufb01t to those outside the arrangement.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa51964b-bb07-40df-ac81-98cfbfba500f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa51964b-bb07-40df-ac81-98cfbfba500f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be440b1078f5800e1640d0b89c49ba0c97a1a138ef11503825949b02f2908f84"}, "2": {"node_id": "086e8831-d75e-419c-8b13-5a94afb85c51", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d33695019696cedb38b08973102ae70ad0ca028fee6c2f95b8be7be55374825"}}, "hash": "e1d6f73ddd9d774925f4e6b164304231d1d3ccef21406162703ba3d41d1b7607", "text": "In addition, developing countries may get special bene\ufb01ts from other countries, and they may have special arrangements among themselves without others getting the bene\ufb01ts.

Tariffs In general, goods exported from one country to another country must be allowed unrestrained entry into the latter. However, a country may apply tariffs, i.e., customs duty, on a product at the time of import. Tariffs have three functions: (i) they provide revenue to the government; (ii) they protect domestic products from competition with imported products, as the latter becomes more costly due to tariffs; and (iii) they are instruments in development policy for discouraging non-priority imports, such as luxury goods, while encouraging priority imports like capital goods and industrial inputs. When a country undertakes obligations in the WTO to \u201cbind\u201d a tariff on a product, it cannot raise the tariff on that product beyond the \u201cbound\u201d level. It may apply a lower tariff at its own discretion. If a country has not \u201cbound\u201d the tariff on a particular product, it is free to put any level of tariff on it. The bound levels for a country - 11 - are included in that country\u2019s tariff schedule, which is kept in the WTO for the record. Because the imported product becomes more costly when a tariff is levied than without it, the tariff has a restraining effect on the import. A country cannot apply any other restraint on the import, except in speci\ufb01c cases, as explained below. Contingency protection There are some speci\ufb01c situations in which a country may restrict imports: Safeguards If the domestic industry of a country suffers serious injury because of increased imports or if there is even a threat of serious injury, the country may put restrictions on imports, either by raising the import duty or by putting quantitative restrictions on the import. A safeguard action must be taken on the import as a whole, not against the import from a particular country. Thus, if an additional tariff is applied as a safeguard measure, it will be applicable to imports from all sources. If quantitative restrictions are applied, an annual limit of imports will be \ufb01xed, based on past imports and then this quantity will be allocated to all the countries generally in proportion to past imports. A safeguard measure is a temporary measure. It can continue only so long as the injury continues. Generally, the maximum duration to apply a safeguard measure is four years. In certain circumstances, it can be extended, but the total maximum period must not exceed eight years. When a country applies a safeguard measure, it has to give compensatory bene\ufb01t to countries that have substantial interest in the export of that product. In absence of compensation, those countries can take retaliatory measures (usually in the form of raising the tariffs on some products of that country). But no retaliatory measure can generally be taken during the \ufb01rst three years of the safeguard measure. Balance of Payment Provision When a country has balance of payment problems (which is the problem of small foreign exchange reserves and low net in\ufb02ows) it may put restrictions on imports by either raising the import duty or by putting quantitative restrictions on imports. Under this provision, restrictions have to be applied to imports of selected products from all sources. A country cannot use this provision to restrict imports of products only from a particular country. General exceptions Imports from a particular country can be stopped under certain conditions that are covered by the general exceptions in the GATT 1994. For example, a country may restrain imports for reasons to protect public morals (e.g., books and magazines considered indecent), to protect life and health of human beings, animals and plants (e.g., injurious food articles or those with improper packaging), and to protect the environment. Relief against unfair trade There are provisions for relief against unfair trade. Two situations of unfair trade have been identi\ufb01ed: (i) subsidy, i.e., bene\ufb01ts given by the government for production or export and (ii) dumping, i.e., export of a product by a \ufb01rm at abnormally low prices. The underlying principle is that products should be able to compete in international markets on their own, without major support from the government. Similarly, prices should not be made arti\ufb01cially low to eliminate competition; for example, a \ufb01rm should generally not export products at prices below the cost of - 12 - production. The agreements on subsidies and anti-dumping are very elaborate and have given rise to a large number of disputes in the WTO. Subsidies Some types of subsidies are totally prohibited.

The Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and other developing countries that have gross national product (GNP) per capita of less than US$ 1,000 per annum are exempted from the prohibition of export subsidies. The prohibition on import substitution subsidies has applied to the LDCs since the end of 2002 and to other developing countries since the end of 1999. One category of domestic subsidy given for production is permitted. This is what is called non-speci\ufb01c or general subsidies, i.e., the subsidies given for production across the board to the entire industrial sector, based on some generally applied criteria. For example, subsidies without any restrictions can be given to small \ufb01rms, based on the criteria of the maximum number of employees or maximum annual value of outputs, applicable to all industrial sectors. Speci\ufb01c subsidies, i.e., subsidies given for domestic production in a speci\ufb01c industrial sector (there are separate provisions for agriculture) or to speci\ufb01c industrial \ufb01rms, have been put under discipline. In practice, such subsidies can continue until some country protests and raises a dispute. Such a situation can emerge if the subsidies are: (i) causing material injury or threatening to cause material injury to the industry of another country or (ii) causing serious prejudice to the industry of another country. The factors for determining injury include declines in output, sale, price, pro\ufb01t, return on investment, capacity utilization, employment and wages. The factors for determining serious prejudice are somewhat less stringent. These include displacing or impeding the import in the subsidizing country, displacing or impeding the export in a third-country market, and price undercutting. In case material injury or its threat exists, a country may impose countervailing duties on the subsidized product to compensate for the effect of a subsidy. Or a country may take to the dispute settlement route and have the subsidy removed. Elaborate rules have been prescribed for determining injury and the quantum of subsidization, which have been the subject of many disputes in the WTO. In case of existence of serious prejudice, there is only one route of relief; a country may resort to the dispute settlement process to have the subsidy removed. Anti-dumping Dumping is said to exist if the export price of a product is less than what is called the normal value, which is generally the price of the product in the exporting country. If the price in the exporting country is not possible to determine or if the comparison is not possible, there are alternative methods for determining the normal value. It may be taken as the price of the product when exported to a third country. Alternatively, it may be constructed on the basis of the cost of production plus a reasonable amount for pro\ufb01t and associated expenses. Again, like a subsidy, it has to be ascertained that there is material injury or threat of material injury to the domestic production. If it is established that injury is caused or threatened by the dumped import, an anti-dumping duty may be imposed. This process has been the subject of several disputes in the WTO. - 13 - Standards A country has the right to specify standards for products. Of course, the main condition is that the principles of MFN and national treatment will apply in this case. Hence, the standard has to be applied to the product from all countries as well as to the domestic product. There is an agreement on this subject in the WTO called Agreement on the Technical Barriers to Trade. Setting standards and applying them has to conform to the process prescribed in this agreement. Preference is given to the standards set by international institutions. Therefore, it is desirable for developing countries to participate in these institutions in formulating standards; otherwise, the standards may be set without keeping the situations of these countries in view. Procedural provisions There are rules in the WTO on procedural provisions, such as customs valuation, licensing in the case of monitoring or restraining imports (whenever import restraint is permitted), and operation of state trading enterprises. Negotiations are on-going in the area of trade facilitation, covering the processes of customs clearance, transit of goods and noti\ufb01cation. This area is one of four subjects among the \u201cSingapore issues\u201d (to be discussed in detail in the chapter on New Issues) that has been taken up in the current negotiations.

Agriculture remained under a soft discipline in the GATT system right from the beginning. Efforts had been going on for a long time in order to work out a set of new rules in this area, but it proved dif\ufb01cult. Finally, an agreement was concluded in the Uruguay Round, and agriculture came within the special discipline of the Agreement on Agriculture (AOA) since the beginning of 1995. The disciplines are broadly covered in three areas: market access, domestic subsidies (termed as domestic support in the agreement) and export subsidies. Three points in the area of market access are important. First, all quantitative restrictions were abolished with the advent of WTO at the beginning of 1995. Second, the tariffs on some products are very high - - sometimes even as high as 200-300 percent -and thus prohibitive. Third, there is a special safeguard process (SSG) under which domestic production can be protected by additional tariffs even without proving injury. But the criteria for applying SSG are such that developing countries, except a few, cannot use it. The subject of domestic subsidies in agriculture has become a matter of major concern in the WTO. Developed countries are using it in large measures; and they are hesitant to eliminate it. Broadly, there are three types of domestic subsidies in agriculture, commonly described as being in the amber box, blue box and green box. (These terms came into use during the Uruguay Round negotiations and have continued since then. However, they have not been used in the AOA and thus do not have any formal and technical standing). These boxes are explained below. \u201cAmber Box\u201d subsidies are the domestic subsidies covered by Article 6.2 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, technically called the Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS). They are measured - 14 - mainly in terms of the difference between the domestic price and the international price; they are subject to reduction. \u201cBlue Box\u201d subsidies are the domestic subsidies covered by Article 6.5 of the AOA. They are a direct payment to producers based on area/yield, and not subject to reduction in the AOA at present. \u201cGreen Box\u201d subsidies are the domestic subsidies covered by Annex 2 of the AOA. They include various types of direct payments to producers; they are not subject to reduction. There are proposals in the most recent negotiations to reduce the blue box subsidy and to clarify criteria for the green box. Moreover, it is also important to know two other terms that are frequently used in connection with the domestic subsidies in agriculture as follows. De-minimis subsidy: for product speci\ufb01c subsidy in the developed countries, it is 5 percent of the production of that product and, in addition, for non-product speci\ufb01c subsidy, it is further 5 percent of total agricultural production. For the developing countries, it is 10 percent of both. Trade-distorting subsidy: it is the total of amber box, blue box and de-minimis subsidies. Developed countries have been providing a huge subsidy to their own agriculture through these three boxes. Amber box subsidies are subject to reductions in the AOA but blue box and green box subsidies are immune from reduction. The major developed countries ful\ufb01lled their obligation of reducing amber box subsidies, but raised the amounts in the other two boxes, thus retaining their subsidy levels and even increasing them. This \u201cbox shifting\u201d by the major developed countries has caused great worry to developing countries. Green box subsidies are not subjected to the discipline of reduction in the AOA because they are seen as non- trade-distorting. Yet this is not quite a correct premise. The green box has several components like subsidies for research, food aid, income insurance, crop insurance, investment aid, and structural adjustment assistance for taking away resources from agriculture. It also includes direct payment to farmers simply as support that is de- coupled from production and price. Many of these payments, particularly direct payment support, insurance against income loss and investment aid enhance the staying capacity of farmers in their agricultural production that is considered unviable. In this manner, it distorts production and trade, hence, the presumption that the green box subsidies are non-trade-distorting is not correct. Blue box subsidies were carved out in the Uruguay Round mainly to accommodate the European Union, and even though they were acknowledged to be trade-distorting, no reduction was envisaged. It was expected that the EU would reduce blue box subsidies and \ufb01nally eliminate them. In fact, the United States removed its own blue box subsidies. However, the EU did not eliminate its blue box subsidies, and the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cabce71b-a4df-4f28-9f19-3bc5ed6691b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "cabce71b-a4df-4f28-9f19-3bc5ed6691b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95001026f0bcaa9a32296ca92f2b40de038747f420a25a61f89a2f369367a477"}}, "hash": "95001026f0bcaa9a32296ca92f2b40de038747f420a25a61f89a2f369367a477", "text": "US reconsidered its position and thought of reinstituting them. These subsidies are helping the EU and US to export their agriculture and to protect their farmers against imports. Other developed countries like Japan, Switzerland and Norway also use domestic subsidies in high proportion to their production, thereby protecting their farmers against imports. But they do not export their agricultural products, so they do not put the farmers of other countries at risk of losing their income and livelihoods. All these practices will be explained in more detail in the chapter on Main Issues at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. Major developed countries also use export subsidies in agriculture. The main user of export subsidies in the form of direct payment is the European Union. The US - 15 - uses export subsidies mainly through export credits and food aid. Hong Kong Ministerial Conference has decided to remove export subsidies by 2013. Implications for developing countries in all these areas and currently con\ufb02icting interests will be discussed in the chapter on Main Issues at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. Opportunities and risks for developing countries Up to the mid-1980s, there was no serious demand on developing countries in the GATT system to undertake obligations. The exercise of exchanging concessions was mostly limited to developed countries. However, through the operation of the MFN clause, explained earlier, the bene\ufb01t also was available to developing countries that were members of the GATT system. Two points are noted in this connection. Through the exercise of mutual concessions, developed countries reduced their tariffs on products of their mutual interests, thus leaving tariffs on products of interest to the developing countries at comparatively high levels. For example, their average tariff is now quite low, nearly 4 percent; but within this average they have tariffs as high as 15-30 percent, which are generally placed on products of interest to developing countries, such as textiles and clothing, food processing and footwear. The challenge for developing countries in the current negotiations is to get the tariff peaks and high tariffs. Developing countries got the bene\ufb01t of lower tariffs on several products and some countries used it to their advantage, by improving their exports and share in international trade. Yet it was not totally a one-sided bene\ufb01t. As countries rose on the development ladder, they provided opportunities for developed countries to expand their markets in these countries. Developing countries absorbed a signi\ufb01cant part of increased production in developed countries. This process has been a mutual gain for developed countries and developing countries that utilized the lower tariffs. It must be noted that a large number of developing countries have not been able to derive bene\ufb01ts from lower tariffs due to their weak supply capacity in these products. From an economic development angle there is concern that some provisions of the agreements in the area of goods are not conducive to development. For example, the principle of national treatment prohibits special facilities for domestic products that face competition from imported products that often are backed by massive resources from \ufb01rms in developed countries. It hampers the development of domestic production. Furthermore, foreign exchange balancing is not permitted; thus, a country cannot stipulate that imports by a \ufb01rm should be \ufb01nanced, at least in part, by the export of its products. This rule may constrain the development process when foreign exchange is scarce. Developing countries also face various forms of protectionism in developed countries. As tariffs in those countries were lowered, protection began through quantitative restrictions on imports. Many sectors of interest to developing countries were seriously affected in this manner. The main examples include textiles, leather goods and jute goods. Quantitative restrictions were \ufb01nally eliminated in the Uruguay Round. Then developed countries applied other methods of protection, e.g., anti- dumping processes. A large number of anti- dumping investigations against exports from developing countries commenced in several major developed countries. Sometimes no injury or dumping was found in the enquiry and the anti-dumping process was dropped. However, the damage already was caused because of uncertainties created by the anti- dumping investigation. - 16 - Sometimes, developed countries would resort to repeatedly launching investigations on a particular product, which would, in effect, harm prospects for developing countries to export it. Exports from developing countries also were stopped sometimes on grounds of safeguarding the environment. In several cases, dispute settlement panels in the WTO found these restrictions illegal. These techniques of neo- protectionism in developed countries have been the cause of major concern among the developing countries.

The option for using quantitative import controls already has been much curtailed; thus, now the only protection for the domestic industry is through tariffs. If tariffs are bound at low levels, as demanded by developed countries, the process of industrialization in developing countries may suffer. If developing countries take a binding commitment to quickly lower their tariffs on a large scale, they may lose the opportunity to move up on the scale of higher technological production. Then there is risk in the agriculture sector. Developing countries are under pressure to lower their tariffs, whereas developed countries are not prepared to eliminate their own domestic subsidies. This imbalance will leave the farmers in developing countries in a vastly disadvantaged position, thereby threatening their income and livelihood. These issues are to be handled prudently in the current negotiations. A more detailed account will be given in the chapter on Main Issues at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. - 17 - 4. TRADE IN SERVICES Background The services sector is covered under GATS. This subject entered the multilateral trading system in the beginning of 1995 as a result of the completion of GATS in the Uruguay Round. Developed countries initiated the agreement, expecting signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts to their economies by the liberalization of services sectors in all countries, particularly the developing countries. They were being pushed to liberalize services by various pressure groups, particularly the \ufb01nancial services. The GATS is centred on the liberalization of services, which entails curtailing the functions of government that regulate the entry and operation of foreign services and service providers in the country. There are two broad categories of obligations on liberalization. First, general obligations, applied to all service sectors: for example, the principle of non-discrimination, Most Favoured Nation treatment (MFN), explained in the chapter on Trade in Goods; and rules regarding the recognition of quali\ufb01cations and standards. Second, speci\ufb01c commitments of liberalization in speci\ufb01c services sectors apply. Modes of supply The obligations on speci\ufb01c sectoral commitments are in terms of the modes of supply of service. Four modes of supply have been envisaged. Because there are frequent references to these modes of supply when talking about services negotiations or commitments, it is important to be familiar with their content. The four modes of supply of service are: Mode 1: Supply of service from one country to another country; for example, supplying a software programme or an engineering design of a machine by a person/\ufb01rm from one country to a person/\ufb01rm in another country; Mode 2: Provision of service in a country to the consumer of another country; for example, providing medical treatment in a country to a person of another country; Mode 3: Supply of service by the service supplier of one country to another country through commercial presence in that country; for example, supplying \ufb01nancial service through a banking \ufb01rm by opening a branch in another country; Mode 4: Supply of service by one country to another country through presence of natural persons there; for example, providing advice or repairing a machine in another country by an expert travelling to that country. In short, these four modes are described in the WTO respectively as: i) cross-border supply, ii) consumption abroad, iii) commercial presence and iv) presence of natural persons. The term \u201cnatural persons\u201d refers to men/women workers of a country, as distinguished from the \u201cjuridical person,\u201d which means a legal entity like a company or \ufb01rm. Speci\ufb01c sectoral commitment Under a speci\ufb01c sectoral commitment a country undertakes the obligation to allow the provision of service in a particular sector by a foreign service provider. A country chooses the sectors in which to allow imports, i.e., the provision of service by a foreign supplier. The choice is technically with the country that makes it, but in actual practice, countries enter into negotiations to persuade one another to liberalize their respective service sectors. The \ufb01nal result - 18 - of such negotiations comes in the form of commitments of different countries in different sectors. While agreeing to include a sector in its commitment to liberalize, a country may prescribe some conditions and limitations on market access and national treatment (this term has been explained in the chapter on Trade in Goods). If no condition or limitation is laid down at the time of taking commitment, the presumption is that the country has allowed totally unrestrained liberalization in that sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c91bc808-f8b1-46fc-b519-26f8cdf624db": {"__data__": {"id_": "c91bc808-f8b1-46fc-b519-26f8cdf624db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19b67233219502bce6dce2d51c53741a99bfee616c6885ae714bd66768061746"}, "2": {"node_id": "9bb9c246-9990-492d-9eac-f4154ca7e498", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adba9d45b16a0313a6db795d71903d1712300fcd3642869ee9dbb592e1b42f1b"}}, "hash": "ad5017d3c6a7648274686f489aa7924ead0cc900d2877dc19b8fb6b5e7168908", "text": "The sectors covered by the commitment of liberalization, along with any conditions and limitations, are inscribed in the services schedule of the Member, which is preserved in the WTO as record of commitment.

The \ufb01rst set of negotiations took place during the Uruguay Round. Now another round of negotiation is going on since 2001, for which Guidelines and procedures were formulated in March 2001. The negotiations are being conducted mostly on the basis of what is called the \u201crequest- offer\u201d approach. Countries have given requests to one another specifying sectors in which there should be liberalization, as well as the transactions that need to be liberalized. In addition, countries have given offers to one another that mention where and how much they are willing to liberalize. Further negotiations on the basis of requests and offers will continue. Naturally, a country will try to persuade another to improve its offers, which will be the subject of negotiation. Since the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, a parallel track of negotiation through a plurilateral route has assumed prominence. Many developing countries do not perceive good prospects for themselves in terms of liberalizing services by other countries because they do not have adequate supply capacity to export services. Therefore, they have not considered it necessary to make many offers. The major developed countries would like all countries, including developing countries, to undertake at least minimum liberalization commitments. They have presented proposals under various titles, like a benchmark for commitments and a numerical target for commitments, which they propose should be applicable to all countries. This pressure has created controversy and tension in services negotiations and will be discussed in detail in the chapter on Main Issues at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. Currently, negotiations are also underway to formulate rules on subsidies, safeguards and government procurement. Developing countries are keen to work out an effective safeguard mechanism so that the import of services can be stopped if domestic service supply is threatened by the import. In addition, they want to retain the option to subsidize their services sectors; hence, they are more interested in completing negotiations in these two areas. On the other hand, the major developed countries are interested in ensuring expansion of markets for their services with regard to the services purchased by governments in developing countries for the use of government. Therefore, they are keen to advance negotiations in the area of government procurement. Developing-countries provisions There are two speci\ufb01c provisions regarding special treatment of developing countries in the GATS: First, the increasing participation of developing countries in the services trade - 19 - shall be facilitated by commitments relating to strengthening their domestic supply capacity, improving access to distribution channels, and liberalizing markets in sectors and modes that are of interest to them. Second, in the negotiations for speci\ufb01c sectoral commitments, there shall be appropriate \ufb02exibilities for an individual developing country to open fewer sectors and to liberalize fewer types of transactions. However, it is often observed, that these provisions are ignored by the major developed countries, while they continue to make demands on developing countries in the negotiations. Opportunities and risks for developing countries Since the GATS is about liberalizing the entry of foreign services in a country, the direct bene\ufb01ts from it go to those countries that have developed supply capacity in the services sectors. The agreement is very much unbalanced in terms of bene\ufb01ts. Imbalances increase when sectors that have been prioritized in the negotiations, such as \ufb01nancial and telecommunication services, show supply capacity almost exclusively in developed countries. Even if some developing countries have some supply capacity in several sectors, developed countries have problems with recognizing standards and quali\ufb01cations. They would allow only such services and service providers that conform to their standards and quali\ufb01cations, which are quite high, and sometimes unaffordable for developing countries to attain. Many developed countries have concluded mutual recognition agreements among themselves, through which they recognize each other\u2019s standards and quali\ufb01cations -- but developing countries are mostly left out of these recognition agreements. This understanding among developed countries can be an additional hurdle in developing countries\u2019 services export. Developing countries would have bene\ufb01ted to some extent from liberalization of Mode 4 of supply of service, i.e., supply of service by the presence of natural persons. But developed countries have not been forthcoming with their commitments for liberalization in this area. There is a need for adequate correctives to redress this imbalance. As will be explained in detail in the chapter on the Main Issues at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, the major developed countries are engaged more in putting pressures on developing countries for further concessions, rather than focusing on redressing the current imbalances in the services", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8186799-5108-41eb-aa89-08ffd0702888": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8186799-5108-41eb-aa89-08ffd0702888", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfc5fd8bde03d03f6cf02e7ca21d8211b24e410d8375616472ade0d3286493e2"}}, "hash": "bfc5fd8bde03d03f6cf02e7ca21d8211b24e410d8375616472ade0d3286493e2", "text": "sector. Furthermore, the risk for developing countries is that several signi\ufb01cant sectors, such as education, water supply and public health, may get covered by the obligations and governments may lose their primary role in these sectors. It is important for the developing countries to guard against this danger. - 20 - 5. PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS Background Intellectual property rights like services, is another area that was brought into the multilateral trading system at the insistence of major developed countries, propelled mainly by their pharmaceutical sector. The subject of IPR is very much different from trade. In addition, it is about the protection of monopoly control on intellectual property and it is far removed from the principles of free trade, which form the basis of the WTO. Hence, it does not have a place in the WTO, yet remains in it at the insistence of major developed countries. Their main concern was that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the multilateral organisation handling IPR did not have a proper enforcement mechanism and WIPO agreements\u2019 obligations were rather weak. They chose the WTO with an effective enforcement arm where they could impose the obligations on the developing countries that were their main targets, as the protection of IPR in the developed countries was already quite strong. The Agreement on TRIPS is the framework for IPR protection in the WTO. It lays down disciplines in seven areas of IPR: patent, copyright, trademark, Geographical Indications, industrial design, integrated circuits and undisclosed information. Of these, patent, copyright and Geographical Indications are the most important from the development angle. The need to protect IPR, which is to protect creations of the mind, arises from the notion that the inventor/creator must get adequate \ufb01nancial returns, which presumably provides incentives to innovate. Protection usually is in the form of exclusive rights for production, marketing and use. This raises the price which is borne by the consumer. There has to be a proper balance between the returns for an innovator and the cost to the consumer. A society determines this balance based on its own social, political and economic concepts and priorities. It is not imperative that all countries have the balance at the same level; however, the Agreement on TRIPS, by providing a minimum standard of protection on IPR, prescribes the base for that balance. Obligations for a country The Agreement on TRIPS provides the minimum level of protection on seven types of IPR that a country must have, but a country is free to have higher levels of protection. Because patents and copyrights have important implications for development, the treatment that follows will deal with them. Patent Eligibility for patent An invention is eligible for patent, if it is new, involves an inventive step (it is non-obvious), and is capable of industrial application (it is useful). If an application is made to register patent for an invention, a country has to enquire if it ful\ufb01ls all these conditions; then, if the conditions are ful\ufb01lled, it must register the patent at the national Patent Of\ufb01ce. Invention of both a product and a process can be patented. It is not obligatory for a country to register patents for: (i) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods and (ii) plants and animals, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals. However, a country may, if it wishes, include them in its patents registration system. It is not obligatory for a country to provide patent registration for - 21 - plant varieties, but it is obligatory to provide protection to it through what is called a sui generis system, meaning that a country may devise its own method to provide protection for plant varieties. A country may refuse a patent on the grounds of protection of: (i) public morality, (ii) human, animal or plant life or health and (iii) environment. The period of patent protection is at least 20 years from the date of \ufb01ling of the application for the patent. Rights of the patent owner In the case of a patent on a product, the IPR owner has the right to prevent anybody from producing, selling or importing the product without the consent of the IPR owner. For a patent on a process, the IPR owner has the right to prevent anybody from using the process without his/her consent; thus, it is necessary to obtain the owner\u2019s authorization for a product to be manufactured using that process. Compulsory license The government can give a license to a person to use a patent without the authorization of the IPR owner. This practice is called compulsory license", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed2d5087-5918-427d-afc7-60631ba2f028": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed2d5087-5918-427d-afc7-60631ba2f028", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e28596607ee360539f7a21b54fdddd02697ebb8f20dd3864d07eb727ff0ee862"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9b84e88-fedc-4b20-a504-fd8d39687c7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef6139a63769deb48945457a70d6fa520378de34ed839d0afcc79e225d8757a9"}}, "hash": "4a10ba8947021a419243b15347637cfd02b634f4c35b36c614bd0c0c6a7e58f3", "text": "to distinguish it from the voluntary license given by the IPR owner. The Agreement on TRIPS does not prescribe the grounds on which compulsory license can be given by government; but it prescribes certain conditions, procedures and limitations regarding obtaining a compulsory license. One important condition is that the proposed user of the patent should have made efforts to get authorization from the IPR owner and prove that authorization could not be obtained within a reasonable period (the period is not de\ufb01ned in the Agreement). Also, the IPR owner has to be paid \u2018adequate\u2019 remuneration, which has not been speci\ufb01ed in the Agreement. Many provisions have not been speci\ufb01ed in the Agreement, so governments have the \ufb02exibility to prescribe them. Many countries have formulated legislation to incorporate their own provisions on these subjects. Copyright Copyrights cover protection of authors\u2019 rights in their literary and artistic works, as well as cinematographic works, works of architecture, computer programmes, compilation of data and the rights of performers, phonograms and broadcasting. The period of protection for a literary or artistic work or computer programme is for the life of the author and 50 years after his/her death. For cinematographic work, protection is for 50 years after the work has been made available to the public; for photographic work, it is 25 years from the making of the work; for performers and producers of phonograms, it is 50 years from the year of performance or \ufb01xation; and for broadcasting, it is 20 years from the end of the broadcast. While the patent is for a speci\ufb01c jurisdiction, such as in a country, the copyright is not limited in jurisdiction. The copyright applies to all countries. Furthermore, one does not have to apply for registration of copyright and receive registration, as in the case of patents. Copyright starts becoming applicable on its own after the work\u2019s creation, in accordance with the law of the respective country. Implementation Implementation of provisions within the Agreement on TRIPS has to be done by a country through appropriate legislation, rules and procedures. The Agreement prescribes detailed provisions on judicial processes and other aspects of implementation. - 22 - Risks for developing countries Because the TRIPS framework is for the protection of IPR and monopoly pro\ufb01ts for the IPR owner, direct bene\ufb01ts go to countries that have intellectual property. The IPR owners are mostly in the developed countries and very few in the developing countries. Thus the developed countries get most of the direct bene\ufb01ts from this framework. Some proponents for IPR state that a country would be able to strengthen its technological capacity by ensuring IPR protection. However, experiences of many countries have not shown such a conclusive relationship. On the other hand, there have been clear experiences showing the rise in prices of patented products. The effects -- notably the rising prices of medicines -- have been felt by a signi\ufb01cant number of developing countries. Many countries in the developing world are \ufb01nding it dif\ufb01cult to provide essential medicines to people at affordable prices. Because some countries allowed patenting of processes but not of products in the pharmaceutical sector, their scientists and technologists were able to produce the same products with alternative processes. As a result, they could supply generic medicines at much lower prices. But now these countries too are covered by obligations of product patents; hence, this alternative route of supply at cheaper prices is no longer available. Developing countries also have been the victims of biopiracy. Their plant resources have been appropriated by multinational \ufb01rms for further research, and these \ufb01rms have patented products derived from natural resources. Multinational corporations thus have derived monopoly pro\ufb01ts from developing countries\u2019 plant wealth, without sharing bene\ufb01ts with countries or communities that have nurtured these plants for centuries. The rationale that monopoly pro\ufb01ts provide incentives to invent should be reassessed. Rights over intellectual property have diverged from pure protection of creations of the mind into a path that is more focused on the protection of investment of multinational \ufb01rms that now dominate the \ufb01elds of science and technology. Hence, a new paradigm for protecting intellectual property rights may need to evolve, given this changed context. - 23 - 6.

There are \ufb01xed time limits for various steps. The \ufb01rst step is to give notice to the other country and seek consultation. The objective is to \ufb01nd solutions to the problem without entering into the formal dispute process. If no agreement is concluded within 60 days, the country moves its contention to the Dispute Settlement Body, which will form a panel for settling the dispute. The DSB must decide on a panel immediately; it cannot delay the formation of a panel beyond two meetings. In general, the panel is composed of three independent experts. They consider the case of both sides and give a report within 6 months. If a party decides to appeal, a bench of three experts in the standing Appellate Body (AB) considers the report of the panel and gives its own report within 60 days. Then the report of the panel/AB is considered by the DSB. The report is adopted by the DSB unless there is consensus that it should not be adopted. This \u201cnegative consensus\u201d provision assures its acceptance, as it is not likely that there will be a consensus not to adopt it. At least one country, the one that the report favours, is bound to oppose the rejection of the report; hence, there cannot be a consensus not to adopt the report. If the report of the panel/AB has found the complaint substantiated, it generally recommends that the defendant country take corrective action. Then that country gives its time frame to implement the recommendations of the panel/AB. This time frame is discussed between the two parties. In case there is disagreement on the time frame, there is a provision for arbitration within 90 days. The arbitrator has the guideline in the DSU that generally the reasonable time for full implementation should not exceed 15 months. In case the defendant country does not implement the recommendations of the panel/AB or if the implementation is found to be de\ufb01cient, the complainant country is allowed to take retaliatory measures. Usually these are in the form of increased tariffs on some products imported from the defendant country. Bene\ufb01ts and problems for developing countries The dispute settlement process must be conducted within a \ufb01xed time schedule, and there is no scope for delaying implementation of the recommendations. Thus, the dispute settlement process is a reassuring measure that the recommendations will be implemented according to WTO rules; in general, recommendations are implemented in good faith. As a result, developing countries that are seen as weaker partners in the WTO have reasonable assurance that their grievances will be redressed. However, developing countries face several problems with respect to the dispute settlement process. Some important problems are noted below. First, as mentioned in the chapter on Bouquets and Brickbats, the ultimate weapon for enforcement is retaliation, which is highly impractical for a developing country if a major developed country is on the other side. - 24 - Second, even if the recommendation is implemented, the full relief may take as long as 30 months, in accordance with the time frame for various stages in the DSU. Third, the relief is only prospective; there is no retrospective relief. Finally, the dispute settlement process is costly; thus, a developing country will weigh this option carefully before entering into it. These problems would indicate that there is an imbalance in the capacity to enforce the rights and obligations between a weak developing country and a strong developed country. - 25 - 7. WTO PROCESS Negotiating process It is important to understand the negotiating process in the WTO in order to appreciate why developing countries feel dissatis\ufb01ed and frustrated. The process from the stage of proposal to that of conclusion is brie\ufb02y described below. A proposal is formally made by a country when it tables a paper in the relevant body of the WTO, i.e., the General Council or the council that handles the relevant subject. Then it is put on the agenda of that council. In a formal meeting the country makes a brief statement, followed by quick statements by other countries. The chairperson of the meeting announces that statements have been noted, the proposal will be kept on record, and there will be consultations on it. Thereafter, the speed with which the proposal is handled depends on the importance of the proposal and the \u201cstrength\u201d of the country tabling it. The chairperson, with the assistance of the WTO Secretariat, arranges for informal consultations among the interested countries. The selection of the countries for consultation is made on the basis of perceived interest in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "699aa1fd-564f-436b-a327-767fae8e5efc": {"__data__": {"id_": "699aa1fd-564f-436b-a327-767fae8e5efc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4a49032bc011243c3b1ffca462d5ca64eb689812c6e8fc60d58840434bee6d0"}}, "hash": "f4a49032bc011243c3b1ffca462d5ca64eb689812c6e8fc60d58840434bee6d0", "text": "matter. Generally, in these small-group consultations almost all developed countries are represented one way or another. Only a few developing countries are present. If the proposal is important, the chairperson makes interim reports in the open meetings of the relevant WTO body that he/she is continuing with the consultations. A brief summary of the issues being discussed may be given on some occasions. Finally, when an agreement is reached in the consultations, the chairperson announces it in an open meeting of the WTO body and places it for approval/adoption by the body. It is usually approved, since a country that has not participated would hesitate to hold up agreement at this stage. In this manner, agreements are reached in small-group consultations and \ufb01nally adopted by the WTO body. A large number of developing countries are not present during these consultations. Most only see the proposal in the beginning and at the end. The rights and obligations involved in the agreement are binding to all countries, however, whether or not they have participated in the consultation process. A somewhat similar process is applied during comprehensive negotiations, e.g., Ministerial Conferences or General Council meetings that cover many subjects altogether. Very little is accomplished in open formal meetings. Negotiations are conducted mostly in small groups; then results are brought before the larger bodies for consideration and approval. Developing countries have been expressing concern at such restricted and non-inclusive negotiating processes during the various Ministerial Conferences. Strengths and weaknesses of developed and developing countries Developed countries coordinate among themselves during the preparations and actual negotiations. Their governments regularly consult with their industry, trade and services sectors. In this way, the political and strategic strengths of governments are combined with the economic and technological muscle of multinational \ufb01rms. This union results in a formidable force. Major developed countries begin by clearly identifying their objectives in the negotiations; they undertake intense technical work in the preparation of proposals and supporting arguments, and they cooperate closely at all stages. With respect - 26 - to pressuring developing countries, they often divide the task among themselves in order to be most effective. On the other hand, developing countries are weak in the preparation of proposals and in negotiations. The subjects of negotiations are very complex. Developing countries, except perhaps a very few, are not adequately equipped to handle them. In addition, they suffer from a lack of con\ufb01dence in taking strong positions, since their economies are very vulnerable. The role of developing countries in these negotiations has also changed signi\ufb01cantly: Earlier, they negotiated to receive concessions, while now negotiations are more about their giving concessions to developed countries, which is a dif\ufb01cult exercise. In general, when major developed countries decide to bring a subject to the GATT/WTO arena in order to \ufb01nd agreement, they do not give up easily, even if the topic is promptly rejected by developing countries. They keep it alive in some manner and proceed later. Often they use a step-by- step approach, or \u201csalami technique.\u201d There may be a decision just to study the subject in the GATT/WTO. Then developed countries try to raise the subject\u2019s status to negotiation and come to a modest agreement if all their demands are not fully met. In the process of implementation and review of the agreement, they try to expand the scope of coverage and the level of obligation. An important example is the area of services, which has a history of expansion of coverage right from the GATT Ministerial Meeting of 1982 up to the most recent negotiation. Developed countries have tried similar techniques with the \u201cSingapore issues\u201d -- to be discussed in the chapter on new issues -- but these techniques have not succeeded so far in these new areas. It is important to keep in mind, however, that these issues have not been excluded from the agenda of the WTO; they have merely been excluded from the Doha negotiations. The experience of developing countries in the GATT/WTO has been that their numerical strength has not helped them. Despite the rule of \u2018one-country one-vote\u2019 developing countries do not have a decisive voice, while developed countries mostly get what they want, sooner or later. This is the big irony of the GATT/WTO process. The real reason lies in the strengths and strategies of developed countries, as explained above, and the weakness of developing countries. A large number of developing countries remain silent in WTO meetings and discussions. They are generally dif\ufb01dent because of their lack of knowledge on a particular issue under consideration. Sometimes they are indifferent because the subject under consideration may not", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79e81a52-77ad-4fbd-8188-a9881372901a": {"__data__": {"id_": "79e81a52-77ad-4fbd-8188-a9881372901a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b9f90c44cf58930fa634f25d242010897c7c44f132b0d715763aaa790b7cd4e"}}, "hash": "9b9f90c44cf58930fa634f25d242010897c7c44f132b0d715763aaa790b7cd4e", "text": "be perceived as directly relevant for their countries. Moreover, they are reluctant to annoy the major developed countries by their opposition. Such hesitation and indifference, however, do not absolve developing countries from the obligations that emerge out of the decisions and agreements. But some change has been noticed recently, as more developing countries have become increasingly vocal. Also, their preparation has improved. All this needs consolidation and strengthening. What should the developing countries do? First, there should be an effective mechanism for determining national interests with respect to a speci\ufb01c proposal, which requires weighing the pros and cons. It is a complex process. Almost everything under consideration in the WTO may have differential impacts on different sections of the population. Through a process of detailed analysis and wide consultation with the stakeholders, the government has to de\ufb01ne what would be in the overall national interest. For this purpose, it is necessary to build structured mechanisms to have consultations and interactions with farmers, industry, trade groups, NGOs, academics, - 27 - media, and so forth. Special mechanism should be established to take into account the interests of vulnerable groups of men and women. The country\u2019s parliament also should remain fully informed about the ongoing negotiations and the emerging agreements. Within the limits of the country\u2019s constitution, the parliaments may issue guidelines to the government on negotiations. Because the WTO agreements now greatly intrude into domestic economic policy, an effective role of the parliaments in developing countries is useful and necessary. It is relevant for the parliament to satisfy itself that the \ufb01nal results of the negotiations can bene\ufb01t the country commensurate with the concessions it has made. An active interest and role of the parliament will keep the negotiating arm of the government alert and cautious. Second, there should be thorough preparation on the subject so that the position of the country is clear and effective in the negotiations. Third, the country should build a coalition with other countries on its proposal and its position. Forming coalitions on speci\ufb01c subjects and issues is, of course, a necessity, but it is also useful to have ongoing coalitions among some countries across the spectrum of subjects and issues. Some experiences of past and recent coalitions are worth recalling. Developing countries have good experiences in forming coalitions in the textiles sector. Textile-exporting developing countries established their own institution for support in the negotiations and for policy coordination in the 1980s; the coalition proved very useful. In the recent negotiations, developing countries have formed various coalitions in the areas of agriculture, industrial tariffs and services. The examples are: Group 20 (a group of developing countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Venezuela, etc.) that want developed countries to reduce their tariffs and subsidies; Group 33 (a group of developing countries, with Indonesia as convenor, that focuses on food security, rural development and livelihood security; some countries are both in this group and in Group 20); ABI (Argentina, Brazil and India, which gave a proposal for a relevant coef\ufb01cient based on the current average tariff in the NAMA negotiations); Caribbean countries group (which has made speci\ufb01c proposals in the areas of agriculture and NAMA); Group of 14 developing countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, Kenya, and Malaysia, which have combined to oppose the new proposals of the developed countries in the area of services. Developing countries should consider forming coalitions right at the preparation stage so that they pool their resources for research and analysis. Fourth, developing countries must \u201cspeak out\u201d in the WTO; it is particularly important in a multilateral negotiating process. A basic difference exists between bilateral negotiations and multilateral negotiations in this respect. In bilateral negotiations, if a country remains silent and hears the other country out, it may be advantageous in assessing how far the other side can go. For the same reason, the other side will provoke a country to speak in order to ascertain its position and \ufb02exibility. In multilateral negotiations, on the other hand, if a country is silent it suits the other countries -- particularly those that hold different views -- because then a decision can be taken without any additional complexity arising through the intervention of this country. Hence, in multilateral negotiations it is necessary for a country to take the initiative and voice its views clearly. Fifth, at the end of the negotiations, a developing country should, before accepting the result, \ufb01rst evaluate the outcome to assess - 28 - whether it is: (i) balanced, (ii) in consonance with its development goals, and (iii) possible to implement without excessive additional resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de076a36-7f67-44aa-a607-90a1101b7863": {"__data__": {"id_": "de076a36-7f67-44aa-a607-90a1101b7863", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30d1463a79f732a026cbd507deb941713f63e9fc86ff3eb8ba941a1a8739d0cb"}}, "hash": "30d1463a79f732a026cbd507deb941713f63e9fc86ff3eb8ba941a1a8739d0cb", "text": "These should be the essential criteria for testing a result before accepting it. The balance of concessions should be judged on the basis of the new rights and obligations as compared to the earlier ones. Often a negotiator may try to justify an agreement on the basis that the country has conceded much less than what had been the demand on it, but that is not a correct reference for assessing a new agreement. The way ahead in the WTO negotiations is going to be extremely dif\ufb01cult. A good feature is that developing countries now have much more information than before. At the same time, civil society groups in developing countries and developed countries have become active, and their efforts and initiatives mostly tend to be supportive of developing countries. - 29 - 8. NEW ISSUES Background The major developed countries brought four new subjects for consideration in the Singapore Ministerial Conference in 1996 and wanted to start negotiations in the WTO to have new multilateral agreements in these areas. These subjects were investment, competition, government procurement, and trade facilitation. A large number of developing countries opposed this move. Developed countries lowered their ambition, and took a decision to simply study these subjects in the WTO. Thus, a foothold in the WTO was ensured. With respect to government procurement, the decision was to work towards a framework for an agreement on transparency in government procurement. After about two years, developed countries again started putting pressure for starting negotiations and concluding agreements in these areas. A large number of developing countries resisted determinedly. Developed countries\u2019 pressure was so intense, however, that the whole WTO system became destabilized, which subsequently led to the collapse of the Cancun Ministerial Conference in 2003. Finally, a decision was taken in the WTO in July 2004 to have negotiations on just one new subject, i.e., trade facilitation, and to drop the other subjects from the Doha negotiations. Thus, the pressure diminished with respect to investment, competition and government procurement. Nevertheless in view of the past tactics of developed countries, it is likely that they may resuscitate the proposals in the future. Hence, it is necessary for developing countries to remain prepared at all times in order to respond to new pressures that may emerge soon after the Doha negotiations are over. The implications of these three new subjects for development are explained in brief below. Investment Having ensured the expansion of the economic space in developing countries for their industries, trade, service providers and innovators through the WTO agreements, developed countries have their sights now on expanding opportunities for their investors in developing countries. They want to ensure their free entry and operation in developing countries, thereby eliminating or limiting the role of governments in regulating the entry and operation of foreign investment. The implications are serious from the perspective of developing countries. Foreign investment may be useful to them in augmenting their \ufb01nancial resources for investment and also for technological development, but the bene\ufb01ts are not automatic. Unguided foreign investment may be harmful in some circumstances. Intervention through government policies and measures is necessary to ensure that foreign investment is really bene\ufb01cial to both parties. Therefore, the government should retain its role in guiding the entry and operation of foreign investment, which is further explained below. In general, the objective of foreign investors is to get high pro\ufb01ts in quick, easy and assured ways. They will decide on sectors for investment, the geographical location, the sourcing of supply of raw materials and other inputs, on the basis of this priority. The priorities of the host government, on the other hand, will be to use foreign investment for the production of exportable goods directly or indirectly; development of essential and critical infrastructure facilities such as power, transport and communications; establishment of production units in speci\ufb01c undeveloped regions; technological upgrading of domestic production; employment and upgrading of - 30 - the skills of the workforce; enhancement of the innate strength of the production process, and so forth. If these two sets of objectives coincide or are harmonized, there is no problem. But generally it is unlikely that this happy coincidence will occur. Herein lies the need for the government to have an effective role in channelling and guiding foreign investment. It is often put forth that a multilateral agreement on investment will improve the \ufb02ow of foreign investment to developing countries. But this may not be correct, because foreign investment depends to a large extent on the economic, political and social environment of the host country, rather than on its policies on the entry and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "099be289-5df0-4ac2-9c21-5513bf7a3bc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "099be289-5df0-4ac2-9c21-5513bf7a3bc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbc0129cb4d31a79a192f856b541a1f055ae00a07ebb3dc2ea90caa5e9c5777b"}}, "hash": "fbc0129cb4d31a79a192f856b541a1f055ae00a07ebb3dc2ea90caa5e9c5777b", "text": "operation of investment. Several developing countries, for example, in Africa, have a totally free regime for foreign investment, but are not getting the investment they need. On the other hand, some countries that have tight control on the entry and operation of foreign investment attract foreign investment in a signi\ufb01cant way. Developing countries rightly have not been convinced by such arguments. The objective of the major developed countries, as mentioned above, is to restrict the role of the government. If they succeed, the development options will be curtailed. Hence, developing countries have been opposing a multilateral agreement on investment in the WTO. Competition Another objective of developed countries is to have a multilateral agreement on competition in the WTO that will further restrict the options of governments in developing countries to modulate and guide the operations of foreign \ufb01rms. Basically, they would like developing countries to adopt the competition policies prevalent in developed countries. These competition policies have serious implications. Healthy competition may facilitate the availability of goods and services of better quality at cheaper prices and may encourage improvement in productivity and supply. A good competition policy should achieve these objectives. Yet some con\ufb02icts of interest exist, for example, those between the interests of the consumer and the producer; those between a large and established producer and a new entrant or small producer; and those between the interests of foreign \ufb01rms and domestic \ufb01rms. A country strikes a balance between these con\ufb02icts and decides its competition policy based on its development objectives, which must be a dynamic process. A country normally modulates its competition policy in order to achieve new balances between various con\ufb02icting interests and to ensure healthy competition appropriate to its level of development. Japan is an eminent example because it modulated its competition policy in the process of economic development from the late 1940s to 1980s, in order to suit its needs of fast industrialization. This type of \ufb02exibility is what major developed countries want to curtail in developing countries. Their proposals will constrain developing countries from modulating their development policies according to their own objectives and priorities. Developed countries also want to ensure certain standards of competition policy in developing countries that may be aimed at permitting large foreign \ufb01rms to operate without inhibitions in these countries. In this process, domestic \ufb01rms may be constrained in their growth and may not be able to reach levels of international competitiveness. Gradually domestic \ufb01rms may collapse, leaving the \ufb01eld free for the operations of foreign \ufb01rms. Developing countries have been opposing a multilateral agreement on competition in the WTO because of all these fears. - 31 - Government procurement Government procurement, i.e., purchases for government use, in developing countries has attracted major developed countries because they perceive big market opportunities, which may not be automatically available to their \ufb01rms. Government procurement involves a very large volume of transactions, often much larger than commercial transactions in the country. At present, government procurement is not covered by the disciplines of MFN treatment and national treatment. Therefore, a developing country has the right to freely choose the source of supply for government procurement and it has the right to give preference to the supply from a particular country as well as the supply from domestic sources. The aim of major developed countries is to constrain this freedom in order to ensure full market access in developing countries with respect to government procurement. Facing stiff opposition from developing countries, developed countries limited their ambitions to having an agreement on transparency in government procurement. Of course, such transparency is desirable, particularly in developing countries, because it will lead to improvement in internal decision-making processes and perhaps widen the supply base. Developing countries, however, perceived two main risks in this exercise in the WTO. They feared that the exercise would expand and spill over into the area of market access. They also feared that a multilateral framework on transparency could impose an unduly heavy burden on them. Their apprehensions were fully justi\ufb01ed because the major developed countries continued making announcements at very high levels, stating that the exercise on transparency was only the \ufb01rst step, and the next step would be market access. Also the proposals of developed countries in the area of transparency appeared very much burdensome. Vigilance in the future Some respite exists because these three new issues have been omitted from the ongoing Doha negotiations. But considering the past history of persistence of developed countries, as explained in the chapter on the WTO processes, developing countries should not be complacent.

The danger also exists through the route of bilateral free trade agreements and regional trade agreements.

MAIN ISSUES FOR HONG KONG CONFERENCE Background The Hong Kong Ministerial Conference of the WTO was the sixth in the series of these conferences and followed up on the negotiations launched by the Doha Ministerial Declaration in November 2001. Preparations preceded the Conference for about a year, but differences in countries\u2019 positions, particularly between developed and developing countries, appeared too wide to be bridged. The negotiations were held within the twin framework of Doha Ministerial Declaration and the decision of the WTO General Council at the end of July 2004, commonly called the \u201cthe July Framework.\u201d From the 16 initial subjects in the Doha negotiations (with investment, competition and government procurement dropped) three have been at the centre-stage of the negotiations: agriculture, industrial tariffs (more technically called non-agricultural market access, or NAMA), and services. Two subjects sponsored by the developing countries: implementation issues and special and differential treatment, did not move forward because of technicalities and procedural problems. Negotiators repeatedly failed to meet deadlines in these two areas. Other subjects proceeded with lukewarm interest. The state of play in agriculture, NAMA and services is provided below. Agriculture Main areas of negotiation The negotiations at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference were in three main areas: tariffs, domestic subsidies and export subsidies. Other subjects like non-tariff barriers, e.g., stopping imports by the major developed countries on the grounds of protection of health have receded into the background. Export subsidies The July Framework decided that export subsidies, mostly given by the EU in the form of direct payments and by the US as export credit and food aid, would be terminated within a time frame to be decided. It is indefensible that developed countries wanted to give export subsidies for their agricultural products, because that helped push exports into developing countries, which jeopardized farmers\u2019 livelihoods. The Group of 20 (coalition of some developing countries including Argentina, Brazil, China, and India) asked for its abolition in \ufb01ve years. The US had given a similar proposal, but the main provider of export subsidies, the EU, had not been clear on a time frame. The apprehension had been that the EU might consider a much longer period, perhaps more than 10 years. Finally, it was decided in the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference to eliminate the export subsidy by 2013. Domestic subsidies As explained in the chapter on Trade in Goods, domestic subsidies are given by developed countries through three boxes, amber, blue and green, as well as through a de minimis provision. The amber box subsidy was subject to reduction in the AOA. The blue box and green box subsidies were not subject to reduction. The green box had immunity on the grounds that it was not trade-distorting, while the blue box was omitted from a reduction commitment in the Uruguay Round based on the EU\u2019s insistence, even though it was considered to be trade- distorting. The presumption that the green box was not trade-distorting appears incorrect, as - 33 - explained in the chapter on Trade in Goods. Much of the payment through this box goes into enhancing the staying capacity of the farmer, thus encourages unviable production. In this manner, it distorted production and trade. However, the major developed countries were not prepared to have constraints on their \ufb02exibilities in payment through the green box. Recent proposals were for reducing the amber box, blue box and de minimis subsidy separately and also the sum of these three subsidies which was called the total trade-distorting subsidy (TDS). The reduction of TDS was an extremely important matter. The major developed countries have done a lot of \u201cbox shifting\u201d of domestic subsidies in the past -- for example, by removing a subsidy from the amber box to ful\ufb01l the reduction commitment and then putting that amount, or an even higher amount, in the blue or green box. Fortunately, developing countries have acquired detailed information on all these strategies, which helps them in negotiations. Safety against subsidized imports as well as market access opportunities outside depend on the total subsidy, irrespective of the box in which it has been placed. Hence, to eliminate/reduce the TDS -- i.e., the total of all subsidies that have been acknowledged to be trade-distorting -- has been the most relevant. The EU and US had offered to cut their amber box subsidies by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c11ce046-ba82-4d9a-979a-b860bcd09ff9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c11ce046-ba82-4d9a-979a-b860bcd09ff9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17c4f67f18e09f2f61130a62dec5e3857739a402ed603e9cea80951086b2ada9"}}, "hash": "17c4f67f18e09f2f61130a62dec5e3857739a402ed603e9cea80951086b2ada9", "text": "70 and 60 percent respectively, their de minimis subsidies by 80 and 50 percent, their blue box subsidies to a ceiling of 5 and 2.5 percent of the agricultural production and their TDS by 70 and 53 percent.

The proposed cuts were from the permissible levels of subsidies, but the applied levels of subsidies, both in the US and EU, were already lower than the permissible levels. Further, the EU made a domestic plan by which it would reduce its subsidies to even lower levels by 2008. Calculations have shown that the proposed cuts would not reduce the TDS in the US below its applied subsidy, nor would it lower the TDS of the EU below the level it had planned for 2008. In fact, if their proposed cuts were accepted, the US and EU would have had the \ufb02exibility to increase their respective subsidies by as much as US$ 2 billion and 7 billion Euros. Moreover, the new levels of overall subsidy resulting from these offers still would have been high -- nearly 12-13 percent of their agricultural production. Such high subsidies concentrated on a few selected products could result in massive subsidization of these products, if there is no product-speci\ufb01c cap. Furthermore, a new escape route has been proposed through a new blue box that would mainly allow the US to give counter- cyclical payments to farmers (higher amounts when prices are lower). The amounts projected for 2005 and 2006 were US$ 4 billion and US$ 6 billion, respectively. The signi\ufb01cantly wide escape route has been the green box with amounts of US$ 50 billion and 22 billion Euros respectively in the US and EU in 2000, and the possibility of unlimited increases in the future. Developed countries did not want any discipline in the green box. However, the green box as non-trade- distorting is a myth, so there is no reason to keep it immune from reduction. The objective needs to be to eliminate the domestic subsidy in the major developed countries within a speci\ufb01c time frame. Toward that end, there should be effective reduction that is progressive and speedy. The following steps are desirable: First, the target for reduction should be the applied levels of subsidy of the major developed countries, not merely their permissible levels. In addition, the actual reduction should be in the total trade- distorting subsidy. - 34 - Second, the TDS should be eliminated by the end of the implementation period of the agreement in accordance with what would have emerged from the Doha Work Programme negotiations. The most recently applied TDS (irrespective of the permissible level) needs to be reduced by at least 50 percent in the \ufb01rst year of the implementation period. Third, payment of TDS should be exclusively limited to individual farmers; corporate bodies should be excluded. Fourth, there should be a product- speci\ufb01c ceiling on the TDS. Fifth, in the green box subsidy, at least for the direct payment classi\ufb01ed as de- coupled income support, insurance against income loss and investment aid there should be eligibility criterion based on income. For example, only those individual farmers who have average income from all sources that is less than 10 percent of the average annual income in the country should be eligible. Corporate farms should be excluded. Finally, there should be an annual ceiling on payment of the total subsidy, i.e., the trade-distorting subsidy plus the green box\u2019s decoupled direct payments, insurance against income loss and investment aid, to an individual farmer. Market access In the area of market access, there were proposals to reduce tariffs. The proposals did not diverge much so the real problem in this area was the introduction of \u201csensitive\u201d products. This proposal was a likely escape route for developed countries to continue with heavy tariff protection for several important products. The EU proposed as many as 160 sensitive products. It is, however, important that sensitive products should be limited in terms of number and of percentage of domestic production. At the same time, a sensitive product needs to be made ineligible for any special treatment if it is exported beyond a de minimis limit. Special products Developing countries, particularly Group 33, gave proposals to classify some of developing countries\u2019 products as \u201cspecial\u201d products that would need special protection in the interests of food security, livelihoods security, and rural development. The developing countries need to ensure that the criteria of selection of the products are easy and the selected products are allowed adequate and effective protection.

Again, major developed countries gave a lukewarm response. Developing countries would need to ensure that there is an easy and effective SSM for them, which would need to be applicable to all products. The trigger would need to be based on an increase in imports over the previous year, or a decrease in price below the previous year\u2019s level. Both additional tariffs and quantitative import restrictions should be admissible as SSM. Special import restrictions It is necessary to protect farmers of developing countries against subsidized imports from developed countries. Toward this end, there should be a provision that as long as developed countries continue with their export subsidies and domestic subsidies, (i.e., TDS and some elements of the green box subsidy mentioned above) developing countries may apply quantitative import restrictions on such subsidized imports from subsidizing sources. This protection would be different from that through the SSM because it would be applied as recourse against only subsidized imports. - 35 - Industrial tariffs The negotiations on industrial tariffs were focused on two issues: i) reduction of bound tariff rates (binding has been explained in the chapter on Trade in Goods) and ii) including more products under \u201cbinding\u201d (coverage of binding). The structures of tariffs in developed and developing countries are very different. The former have full binding coverage and generally low tariffs (on average about 4 percent), though their tariffs on the products of export interest to developing countries are very high compared to the average. These \u201ctariff peaks\u201d and \u201chigh tariffs\u201d in developed countries have been the main concerns of developing countries. Developing countries have comparatively high tariff rates and, in many cases, low binding coverage. Perhaps because the developing countries were not able to put forth their concerns forcefully, it has been decided in the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference that \u201cSwiss Formula\u201d2 will be the basis for tariff reduction in industrial products. The extent of reduction according to this formula depends on the coef\ufb01cient used in it. The coef\ufb01cient sets the ceiling of the tariff. Further, the higher the coef\ufb01cient, less is the reduction in tariff. Thus, now the critical issue is what should be the coef\ufb01cient in the Swiss Formula. The EU initially proposed a coef\ufb01cient of 10 for all except the LDCs and other weaker developing countries. Such a coef\ufb01cient would suit developed countries quite well because their average tariff is generally low as noted above (around 4 percent). They would have been required to cut their tariff on average only marginally, whereas developing countries 2 t1 = (a x t0)/(a + t0), where t0 is the initial tariff, t1 is the \ufb01nal tariff and \u2018a\u2019 is a coef\ufb01cient. A simple transformation makes it 1/ t1 = 1/t0 + 1/a. For t0 = \ufffd, t1 = a; thus \u2018a\u2019 becomes the ceiling for the \ufb01nal tariff. Further, if the initial tariff is a, 2a, 3a or 4a, the \ufb01nal tariff is respectively 1/2 a, 2/3 a, 3/4 a, and 4/5a. that currently have high levels of tariffs would have been required to cut them by large margins. This was contrary to the Doha Ministerial Declaration that had called for less than full reciprocity in concessions from developing countries. Developing countries have suggested that the coef\ufb01cients for both developed and developing countries be vastly different, considering differentials in their tariff structure. Some have suggested coef\ufb01cients of 6 and 30 for developed and developing countries respectively. Argentina, Brazil and India (ABI) suggested a coef\ufb01cient based on the current average tariff. The Caribbean countries added an index of special situations of countries. Some small economies (less than 0.1 percent share in world trade) offered line- by-line tariff reduction of 15 percent without getting into the Swiss Formula. On the binding coverage, developed countries proposed that the currently unbound tariffs in developing countries be covered by binding and reduction. Developing countries appeared prepared to increase their binding coverage signi\ufb01cantly, but they did not want these newly bound tariffs to be reduced.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d125fd1-1c6c-480f-b3b3-7b5a47250b0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d125fd1-1c6c-480f-b3b3-7b5a47250b0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4df82d0032c6b5dbb9aa18c1fde2f751264c58d51249363a8b4665b847d82c83"}, "2": {"node_id": "add306a3-c12b-46f3-825e-cf3925cc200e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c38d5643fafe2069cbacb89f93f92df173e19b818a5e01ee9a1a26be0b53e92"}}, "hash": "59a56b4cc7aba6b6081068379cc0008e38f71c4dfcff49b92dc45181a4de0753", "text": "Many developing countries have undergone deindustrialization in the wake of lowering their industrial tariffs, at the suggestion and insistence of international \ufb01nancial institutions.

Depending on the importance of the products, they should agree to have a modulated increase in binding coverage. What is important is to have high binding levels in order to ensure \ufb02exible tariff policy in these products. However, the decision in Hong Kong points towards binding in all products. Hence, now the issue will be how high the bound level is. Services Negotiations were proceeding on the basis of a request-offer approach, as explained in the chapter on Trade in Services. Serious problems arose from the new proposals of several developed countries, which used a complementary approach to the negotiations. There are two types of such proposals: (i) benchmarking of liberalization obligations, or quantitative targets for liberalization by all countries and (ii) plurilateral negotiations in speci\ufb01c sectors. The concept of benchmarking or having quantitative targets appears to be inconsistent with the \ufb02exibility given to the developing countries in the GATS to liberalize fewer sectors and fewer transactions. The concept of plurilateral negotiations in speci\ufb01c sectors is inconsistent with this \ufb02exibility if it is compulsory for a developing country to join such negotiations and to undertake obligations. The most appropriate way is to continue negotiations on request-offer approach. Benchmarking or quantitative targets should not be used. Furthermore, if willing countries use the plurilateral approach in some sectors, it should be under two conditions: First, joining these negotiations should be totally voluntary. Second, the results of the plurilateral negotiation should be applied on a MFN basis. It is also important to guard against the inclusion in the negotiations of some critical sectors of social importance, for example, education, public health, and public water supply and sanitation services, which may limit the role of governments in these important activities. Because of stiff resistance from the developing countries, the concept of benchmarking was given up in Hong Kong; but some emphasis has been put on the route of plurilateral negotiations. Least Developed Countries The LDCs have a special position in these negotiations. In both agriculture and NAMA, two special provisions for them are agreed in principle. First, LDCs will not be required to undertake any reduction commitment. Second, developed countries and developing countries that are in a position to do so will give them duty-free and quota-free access for their goods. The Hong Kong Ministerial Conference has decided that there will be duty-free and quota-free access to 97 percent of the products of the Least Developed Countries (LDC). In addition, two other points relevant to the LDCs are under consideration: (i) measures to provide for the erosion of preferences that arise from tariff reductions in agriculture and NAMA, and (ii) measures to treat the issue of high subsidy to the cotton industry in the major developed countries, particularly the United States. In the area of services, appropriate mechanisms will be developed to accord special priority in liberalization to the sectors and modes of interest to the LDCs. These - 37 - mechanisms will need to assist them in identifying their priority sectors and modes of supply, in order to provide targeted and effective technical assistance and capacity building and to develop an effective reporting mechanism. - 38 - 10. POST-HONG KONG DEVELOPMENTS Decisions in Hong Kong and their implications The Hong Kong Ministerial Conference ended with results that were modest. Main decisions and their implications are brie\ufb02y explained below. Agriculture: There are three concrete decisions: (i) export subsidy will end by 2013; (ii) developing countries can self-designate some products as \u201cspecial products;\u201d and (iii) developing countries can retain their permissible de minimis level of domestic subsidy. Industrial tariff (non-agricultural market access, NAMA): There are two speci\ufb01c decisions: (i) reduction of industrial tariff will be done according to the Swiss Formula and (ii) in case of currently unbound tariff, there will be a mark up from the currently applied rates and then reduction will be effected following the formula. These two decisions respectively mean that there will be reduction of tariff on all products and there will be total binding coverage.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3803e28b-bfa6-4479-905c-d1c4c65e4367": {"__data__": {"id_": "3803e28b-bfa6-4479-905c-d1c4c65e4367", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b325dab643310055358dfe2357a3df835ad900c2ae99b6cd90fd842308f3964"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9ab11b5-39e6-4194-b4f8-ae9aa44bdbbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03691c1c3e69e1ff63c05e57bb963becd879eb8ec2ca4c34aaccf68a4c0dfccc"}}, "hash": "3bf2d421e5ba19915f3eb84949e192d948090876e78eed3821e0530b7e489bc2", "text": "Services: Negotiations will be intensi\ufb01ed with the objectives and approaches that: (i) commitments will be taken at existing levels of market access in Mode 1 (supply of service by the service provider of a country to a consumer located in another country) and Mode 2 (supply of service in a country to the consumer coming from another country); and (ii) in respect of Mode 3 (supply of service through commercial presence of a foreign \ufb01rm), there will be enhanced", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "346bff9a-f293-4a40-a6b6-09b4c179ddde": {"__data__": {"id_": "346bff9a-f293-4a40-a6b6-09b4c179ddde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "852c835fb0a4c1990c12086b6b32f26f2b6b3e1f19cc5e1d57abb3cbc9f6a730"}}, "hash": "852c835fb0a4c1990c12086b6b32f26f2b6b3e1f19cc5e1d57abb3cbc9f6a730", "text": "levels of foreign equity participation and elimination or substantial reduction of necessity criteria applied by a country. Least Developing Countries (LDC): There will be duty-free and quota-free access to 97 percent of the products of the Least Developed Countries (LDC). This decision, though very positive, has two points of weakness. There is no decision how this percentage will be determined. Further, the exemption to the extent of 3 percent may allow the major developed countries to stop access of the products in which the LDCs really have export interest. Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS): There is a decision to amend Article 31 of the Agreement on TRIPS to facilitate export of drugs produced under compulsory license to the developing countries that do not have adequately developed manufacturing capacity. Some experts have raised doubts whether the decision will really give bene\ufb01t to these countries in view of the procedural complexity involved. The implication of the decisions in the areas of agriculture, NAMA and services is that whereas there was no move by the major developed countries on eliminating/ reducing their domestic subsidy in agriculture or liberalizing access in Mode 4 of services which have been some of the major concerns of the developing countries, they have already extracted substantial commitments from the developing countries in the areas of NAMA and services. The decision on agriculture allows the major developed countries to continue export subsidy until 2013. Self-designation of special products by the developing countries is a positive move, but it may be ineffective in absence of specifying the number of products to be selected and the special treatment that will be accorded to them. The de minimis subsidy of the developing countries has really - 39 - never been an issue; perhaps the developed countries have raised it as a strategy. Whereas the gains of the developing countries in agriculture are modest, their commitments in NAMA and services are signi\ufb01cant since they have given up their major options and \ufb02exibility in these areas. Never before in the history of GATT/WTO, had the developing countries agreed to cover each of their industrial products by tariff reduction. Earlier they had merely agreed to reduce the average of their industrial tariff, keeping to themselves the option to spread the average across the range of tariff lines in accordance with their development needs and strategy. Now this \ufb02exibility is lost. Similarly, the developing countries have had the \ufb02exibility to keep a number of their industrial tariff lines unbound, which forms a part of the current rights and obligations in the GATT/WTO. The decision in NAMA takes away this right. In the areas of services, the developing countries have already made commitments in Modes 1, 2 and 3, as mentioned above without any commensurate gains to them in Mode 4. In this way, the results in Hong Kong have followed the usual pattern of GATT/ WTO negotiations wherein the developing countries are made to concede much without commensurate gains to them. Post-Hong Kong negotiating process After the intense negotiations since July 2004, the result of Hong Kong was disappointing. Failure to have any breakthrough highlighted the complexity of issues under negotiation and widely divergent interests of countries actively involved in the negotiations. Efforts continued after the Hong Kong Conference; but the main negotiations were conducted in rather restricted and exclusive format with little transparency. The commissioner of the European Commission, representing the European Union (EU), and the ministers of Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, and the US (jointly called \u201cG6\u201d in WTO parlance) assumed the role of prime-movers and started intense talks among themselves to \ufb01nd common ground. The vast majority of WTO membership was not involved in this process. Naturally they were disturbed and expressed their voices of concern from time to time. But the process went along. Much to the frustration of the six prime-movers, however, the events did not turn out quite as they had expected. There was no agreement among the G6 and the talks collapsed in the last week of July 2006. The usual blame-game followed with bitter comments from various members of G6. They decided to suspend their joint deliberation. The Director General of the WTO decided to suspend the negotiating process altogether and informed the Trade Negotiating Committee and the General Council about the suspension. Neither a formal approval was sought from the General Council nor did it formally give its approval; it simply took note of the statement of the DG. Thus, though the countries accepted the suspension, they did not give their seal of approval.

Some observers and experts have expressed doubts whether the negotiations will restart soon and get completed to catch the deadline of the \u201cfast track authority\u201d given by the US Congress to the US executive which expires at the end of June 2007. (This authority enables the US President to submit a trade agreement to the US Congress for acceptance or rejection in its entirety without any scope for changes and amendments.) Yet, there is another side of the picture. The major developed countries have within their grips some signi\ufb01cant concessions from the developing countries - 40 - that they may not like to slip away. They already have the decision of total binding coverage and line-by-line reduction of industrial tariff in the developing countries, as explained earlier. According to their perception, an industrial tariff ceiling of 20 percent (resulting from the coef\ufb01cient of 20 in the Swiss formula) and 35-45 percent reduction in the agricultural tariff in the developing countries are within reach. Besides, signi\ufb01cant liberalization in several services sectors through sectoral plurilateral negotiations also appears approachable. The resulting opportunities for enhanced market access in goods and services in the developing countries may be too important for the major developed countries to ignore. Their manufacturers, exporters and service providers are likely to push the governments to consolidate these gains. The time limit of the fast track authority of the US Congress is of course a material factor in the feasibility of concluding the negotiations. The US executive has to notify the Congress of the agreement by the end of June 2007 which works as the \ufb01nal time target. Some time is needed for the US executive to prepare the noti\ufb01cation. And adequate time is required by the WTO Members to prepare their commitment schedules. The latter may be a time consuming process as the work is complex. But it may be possible to do all this under extreme pressure of time, if the negotiations are not delayed too long. Considering all aspects, it is likely that the developing countries may be caught by a sudden turn of events, leading to the whirlpool of negotiations. Hence, it is prudent that they remain prepared for a renewed negotiation. Points of caution Two points of caution are important. First, it should be recognised that the restrictive and non-inclusive negotiating process as exempli\ufb01ed in the past by mini- ministerial meetings and G6 meetings has not succeeded. It is imperative that the negotiating process is made fully inclusive and totally transparent. The entire membership of the WTO, particularly those that are normally left out of the core negotiations, have to take a lead in making the negotiations inclusive and transparent. Second, there are causes for concern with the type of negotiating results and negotiating trends that seemed to emerge towards the end of July 2006 as explained below. Agriculture In agriculture, even if the proposals put forward by G20 are accepted, it may not help the developing countries effectively. While the attention was rightly focused on reducing the total trade-distorting subsidy, there are two loopholes because of which the commitments of the major developed countries will not be of much use to the developing countries. Even if the EU and the US reduce their total TDS respectively to Euro 27 billion and US$ 12 billion (as required in G20\u2019s proposal), they can still go on enhancing their domestic subsidy by giving it through the route of the green box. Further, the reduced levels of the total TDS, if concentrated on a small number of products, can give arti\ufb01cial competitive strength to these selected products. Both these loopholes have to be effectively plugged. The green box subsidy, particularly those in the form of de-coupled income support, insurance against income loss and investment aid, given respectively under paragraphs 6, 7 and 11 of Annex 2 to the Agreement on Agriculture, must be subjected to some criteria of eligibility and ceiling. For example: (i) these payment should be made only to individual farmers, thus totally excluding the corporate entities, (ii) even among the individual farmers, only the less - 41 - af\ufb02uent ones should be eligible, for example, only those having annual income (from all sources) up to 10 percent of the average annual income in the country and (iii) there should be a ceiling on the amount of annual payment to an individual farmer, say, US$ 5,000-10,000. To safeguard against concentration of the total TDS on a limited number of products, there should be a product-speci\ufb01c ceiling. As the subsidies have been high in the past, the ceiling should not be based on historical", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd514d95-b2c6-4b4a-9522-98c557337cc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd514d95-b2c6-4b4a-9522-98c557337cc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09210191f618f7b7821150aed8dd0c0e331da146ff045f44f71e09e0d031051a"}}, "hash": "09210191f618f7b7821150aed8dd0c0e331da146ff045f44f71e09e0d031051a", "text": "levels. It should be based on some other criterion, for example, as a certain percentage of the annual production. Over and above, it is important for the developing countries to make bolder proposals on the TDS and in some other areas. Developing countries should be enabled to impose quantitative import restrictions on the products that have received TDS or green box subsidy of the types mentioned above. Sensitive products should be limited in terms of number and also in terms of percentage of domestic production. Further, such a product should be ineligible for special treatment if it is exported beyond a de minimis limit. NAMA In the area of NAMA, the proposals under serious consideration are iniquitous. The current \ufb01gures under consideration for the coef\ufb01cient in the Swiss Formula are: 20-30 for the developing countries and around 10 for the developed countries. Taking 30 as coef\ufb01cient for the developing countries, their tariff of 28 percent, which is their average tariff, will be reduced to 14 percent, thus causing a tariff reduction of 50 percent. At the same time, taking 10 as coef\ufb01cient for the developed countries, their tariff of 4 percent, which is their current average tariff, will be reduced to 3 percent, i.e., only by 25 percent. This will be a clear reversal of the agreed principle of \u201cless than full reciprocity\u201d for the developing countries and will be unfair. Hence, a radical departure from the current consideration of the coef\ufb01cients is essential. Let us start with the targets for reduction of tariff in the developed countries and the developing countries respectively by 60 percent and 40 percent. For such reduction in their respective tariffs of 4 and 30, which are close to their respective averages, the coef\ufb01cient for the developed countries should be 2.7 (or 3, after rounding off) and that for the developing countries should be 45. Now that the Swiss Formula has been accepted in Hong Kong as the basis for tariff reduction exercise, the real issue is the coef\ufb01cient to be used in this formula. These are the coef\ufb01cients which the developing countries should be working for. Services In the services, the format of plurilateral sectoral negotiation has become almost a norm and it is likely to work against the interest of the developing countries if adequate precautions are not taken. Plurilateral track of negotiation is, by de\ufb01nition, on commitments in individual sectors/modes. Thus, each of these tracks works in its own groove and is naturally limited in the negotiating scope within that groove. But a real give-and-take in services negotiation is practical only across the sectors and modes. For example, the developing countries have interest in the commitments of the developed countries in Mode 4 (supply of service by movement of persons), while the major developed countries will push for the developing countries\u2019 commitments in Mode 3 (supply of service by the presence of \ufb01rms). If these two sets of negotiations are conducted in the separate grooves of the respective plurilateral groups, there will be no effective give-and-take across these issues. There is a risk that the developing countries may be forced to commit much in Mode 3 with only a limited gain in Mode 4. A proper - 42 - balance in the outcome can be possible if there is a mechanism of taking these two tracks together. An important strategy of the developing countries should be to balance their commitments in Mode 3 with the concessions given by the major developed countries in Mode 4 and also in respect of standards and domestic regulations which often act as barriers to service exports from the developing countries. Other areas Apart from these three areas currently under emphasis, it is also important for the developing countries to bring the development topics of their interest to the centre-stage of negotiations. Some of these items are: special and differential treatment of developing countries, implementation issues and non-tariff barriers in agriculture and industrial products. Finally Though lip service is given to the development objectives from time to time the focus in the crucial phases of the current negotiation invariably shifts to enhancing market access, often ignoring the adverse impact on development. Vast majority of the membership of the WTO are often frustrated by the tendency of the major developed countries to exert intense pressure for expanding the economic space of their manufacturers, traders, investors and inventors in the developing countries, while the development needs get ignored and development objectives are pushed aside. Besides, there has been a spate of regional trading agreements and bilateral trading agreements in recent years wherein the developing countries are pressurized", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2f24396-edf4-420a-b201-ae91f97ce60a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2f24396-edf4-420a-b201-ae91f97ce60a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "World Trade Organization: Notes on the Content and Process", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/world-trade-organization-notes-content-and-process", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c6f03162a334c5e416671d3cd1f001a71d0dea4e20f1bbaa7a6d0afa44c072c"}}, "hash": "4c6f03162a334c5e416671d3cd1f001a71d0dea4e20f1bbaa7a6d0afa44c072c", "text": "to make signi\ufb01cant WTO-plus commitments which constrain their options and \ufb02exibilities further.

It has to be watched whether the renewed negotiations will follow a truly human development path. Eradication of poverty and attaining Millennium Development Goals remain top priorities for the developing countries in national policy and also in bilateral and multilateral agreements; this is what will nurture a healthy international economic relationship, both in the short-term and long-term. - 43 - REFERENCES Das, Bhagirath Lal (1999).
